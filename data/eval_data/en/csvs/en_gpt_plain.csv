0	Our results suggest, but do not confirm, that a possible advantage of ultrasound guidance for the first attempt success rate over other techniques is more pronounced in infants and small children than in older children.	"

Our research shows that ultrasound guidance may help with the success rate of the first attempt more in babies and younger children than in older children, but more research is needed to be sure."	Our evidence suggests that ultrasound is superior to other techniques for arterial catheter insertion, particularly in babies and young children.
1	We included seven trials, involving 735 participants, in this review.	" 

This review looked at seven different experiments that included a total of 735 people taking part."	This review included seven studies (specifically randomised controlled trials), involving 735 people.
2	We searched until January 2016.	"

We looked for something until the end of January 2016."	The evidence is current to January 2016.
3	Remote ischaemic conditioning (RIC) has been developed as a neuroprotective strategy to prevent and treat ischaemic stroke.	"

Remote Ischemic Conditioning is a way to help protect your brain from stroke. It helps to prevent stroke and can also help treat it if you already have one."	Remote ischaemic conditioning (RIC) is a strategy to protect and prevent damage to brain tissue by improving its ability to tolerate reduced blood flow.
4	To assess the benefits and harms of RIC for preventing ischaemic stroke and for treating people with ischaemic stroke and those at risk for ischaemic stroke.	"

This sentence is asking us to find out if a certain type of medical treatment (RIC) is helpful in preventing and treating strokes. We want to know if the benefits of using RIC are greater than the risks."	What are the benefits of using remote ischaemic conditioning (a noninvasive physical therapy that involves inflating blood pressure cuffs to reduce blood flow in arms and legs, and then releasing the affected blood around the body) in people with stroke or those at risk of stroke caused by low blood flow?
5	We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing RIC with sham RIC or medical management in people with ischaemic stroke or at risk of ischaemic stroke.	"

We looked at studies that compared a certain medical treatment called RIC with either a fake treatment or other medical treatments with people who had a stroke or were at risk of having a stroke."	The studies compared RIC with sham RIC or medical management in people with ischaemic stroke or at risk of ischaemic stroke.
6	In people with symptomatic intracerebral artery stenosis, recurrent stroke was significantly reduced by RIC (risk ratio (RR) 0.32, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.12 to 0.83; 2 trials, 182 participants, low-quality evidence).	"

In people who have a blockage in an artery in the brain and are having symptoms from it, taking a certain medicine called RIC was found to help reduce the chances of having another stroke. This was tested in two studies with 182 people, and the results showed that taking RIC decreased the risk of stroke by 32%."	In people with narrowing of arteries in the brain, RIC may reduce the risk of recurrent stroke.
7	Four RCTs compared ultrasound with palpation, and one compared ultrasound with Doppler auditory assistance.	"

Four studies looked at the differences between using ultrasound and feeling with your hands, and one study looked at the differences between using ultrasound and listening with special equipment."	We found five eligible studies - four comparing ultrasound with palpation and one comparing ultrasound with Doppler auditory assistance.
8	Preclinical studies have suggested that RIC may have beneficial effects in ischaemic stroke patients and those at risk of ischaemic stroke.	"

Medical research has shown that a certain type of treatment called RIC may help people who have had a stroke or are at risk of having a stroke."	Studies have suggested that RIC may have beneficial effects for preventing and treating ischaemic stroke.
9	The improved success rate at the first attempt may be more pronounced in infants and small children, in whom arterial line cannulation is more challenging than in older children.	"

This sentence means that when doctors try to put a tube into a baby or small child's artery, it is harder than it is for an older child. But, when doctors do succeed the first time, it is a more noticeable success than when they are working with an older child."	It is likely that ultrasound is more useful for infants and small children than for older children.
10	We searched the Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register (16 January 2018), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2017, Issue 12) in the Cochrane Library (January 2018), MEDLINE Ovid (1946 to January 2018), Embase Ovid (1974 to January 2018), Web of Science Core Collection (1950 to January 2018) and three Chinese databases (January 2018).	"

We looked for information about stroke from six different places: the Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE Ovid, Embase Ovid, Web of Science Core Collection, and three Chinese databases. We looked for information from 1946 to January 2018."	The results of this review are current up to January 2018.
11	We included five RCTs reporting 444 arterial cannulations in paediatric participants.	"

We studied five groups of children and counted how many times doctors put a tube into their blood vessels (called ""arterial cannulations""). In total, 444 kids had a tube put in their blood vessel."	We found five eligible studies - four comparing ultrasound with palpation and one comparing ultrasound with Doppler auditory assistance.
12	The improved success rate at the first attempt may be more pronounced in infants and small children, in whom arterial line cannulation is more challenging than in older children.	"

The chance of being successful the first time is higher in babies and younger children than in older children when doctors try to put a tube into their artery. This is because it is harder to do in babies and younger children."	We found that ultrasound increased the rate of successful cannulation at the first attempt and reduced the formation of haematomas.
13	Meta-analysis showed that ultrasound guidance produces superior success rates at first attempt (risk ratio (RR) 1.96, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.34 to 2.85, 404 catheters, four RCTs, moderate-quality evidence) and fewer complications, such as haematoma formation (RR 0.20, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.60, 222 catheters, two RCTs, moderate-quality evidence).	"

The study found that when doctors use ultrasound to help guide them, they are more likely to get it right the first time (almost two times more likely) and cause less harm (five times less likely) than without ultrasound."	We found that ultrasound increased the rate of successful cannulation at the first attempt and reduced the formation of haematomas.
14	We included three trials (involving 371 participants) in the analysis of the effects of RIC on ischaemic stroke prevention.	"

We looked at the effects of RIC on preventing strokes by running experiments with 371 people. We used the results of these experiments to help us understand the effects of RIC."	Three trials (involving 371 people) were eligible for our analysis of RIC for preventing ischaemic stroke, and another four trials (involving 364 people) were eligible for our analysis of RIC for treating ischaemic stroke.
15	In people with carotid stenosis undergoing carotid stenting, there was no significant difference in the incidence of ischaemic stroke between participants treated with RIC and non-RIC (RR 0.22, 95% CI 0.01 to 4.03; 1 trial, 189 participants, low-quality evidence); however the stroke severity (assessed by infarct volume) was significantly lower in participants treated with RIC (mean difference (MD) -0.17 mL, 95% CI -0.23 to -0.11; 1 trial, 189 participants, low-quality evidence).	"

People with carotid stenosis (a narrowed artery in the neck) had a medical procedure called carotid stenting. In this procedure, some people received a special treatment called RIC (Remote Ischemic Conditioning). The study showed that there was no big difference in the number of people who had a stroke after the procedure between those who received RIC and those who did not. However, the study did show that people who received RIC had less severe strokes than those who did not receive RIC."	In people being treated with stenting (the insertion of a metal or plastic tube) for narrowed arteries in the neck, RIC may reduce the size of new brain injuries caused by reduced blood flow.
16	We rated the quality of evidence for all outcomes as moderate owing to imprecision due to wide confidence intervals, modest sample sizes and limited numbers of events.	"

We looked at all the results and decided that the evidence was only okay. This was because the results were not very exact, and there weren't a lot of people studied, and not many things happened."	We rated the quality of evidence as moderate mainly because the number of studies was limited.
17	It usually involves restricting blood flow to limbs and then releasing the ischaemic blood to promote a neuroprotective effect.	"

This sentence is talking about a medical procedure called Ischaemic Preconditioning (IPC). The procedure involves temporarily cutting off the flow of blood to certain parts of the body and then releasing the blood back into the body. The goal of this procedure is to protect the brain and nervous system from damage."	Remote ischaemic conditioning (RIC) is a strategy to protect and prevent damage to brain tissue by improving its ability to tolerate reduced blood flow.
18	In acute ischaemic stroke, for people receiving intravenous thrombolysis, the rate of death or dependency was significantly increased by RIC treatment compared with non-RIC treatment (RR 2.34; 95% 1.19 to 4.61; 1 trial, 285 participants, low-quality evidence).	"

In people who had a stroke and were given medicine through a vein to try and stop the stroke from getting worse, those who also received a certain type of treatment (called RIC) were more likely to die or be dependent on someone else for help than those who didn't receive the RIC treatment."	Among people with acute ischaemic stroke (where it had only been several hours from symptom onset) who received clot-dissolving medicines, we found that RIC may increase the risk of death or dependency (needing help from others).
19	In people with carotid stenosis undergoing carotid stenting, there was no significant difference in the incidence of ischaemic stroke between participants treated with RIC and non-RIC (RR 0.22, 95% CI 0.01 to 4.03; 1 trial, 189 participants, low-quality evidence); however the stroke severity (assessed by infarct volume) was significantly lower in participants treated with RIC (mean difference (MD) -0.17 mL, 95% CI -0.23 to -0.11; 1 trial, 189 participants, low-quality evidence).	"

People with a condition called carotid stenosis were studied to see if it is better to treat them with a procedure called carotid stenting or not. The results showed that there was not much difference in the number of people who had strokes after the procedure, but the people who had carotid stenting had strokes that were not as bad as the people who did not have the procedure."	However, its effect on clinical outcomes (stroke and death) was unclear.
20	We included four trials (involving 364 participants) in the analysis of the effects of RIC on ischaemic stroke treatment.	"

We looked at four different tests with 364 people to see if RIC (whatever that is) can help treat strokes."	Three trials (involving 371 people) were eligible for our analysis of RIC for preventing ischaemic stroke, and another four trials (involving 364 people) were eligible for our analysis of RIC for treating ischaemic stroke.
21	We also found improved success rates within two attempts (RR 1.78, 95% CI 1.25 to 2.51, 134 catheters, two RCTs, moderate-quality evidence) with ultrasound guidance compared with other types of guidance.	"

This sentence is talking about a study that was done to compare two different types of guidance when using a medical tool called a catheter. The study found that if ultrasound guidance was used, it was more successful than other types of guidance. Out of 134 catheters that were used, the success rate was 1.78 times higher when ultrasound guidance was used. This result was reliable because two different tests were done, and the evidence was of moderate quality."	Ultrasound also increased the success rate within two attempts.
22	We found low-quality evidence that RIC may reduce the risk of recurrent stroke in participants with intracerebral artery stenosis and reduce stroke severity in participants undergoing carotid stenting, but it may increase death or dependence in participants with acute ischaemic stroke who are undergoing intravenous thrombolysis.	"

This sentence is talking about a medical procedure called RIC, which might help people who had a stroke and now have a narrowed artery in their brain. This procedure might make it less likely for them to have another stroke and make their stroke less severe if they are having a procedure done to their neck artery. But, it might also make it more likely for people who just had a stroke to die or have trouble doing things for themselves."	There is low-quality evidence which suggests that RIC may help prevent recurrent stroke in people with narrowed arteries in the brain, and may increase death or dependency in people with acute ischaemic stroke who received clot dissolving medication.
23	Similarly, our results suggest, but do not confirm, the possibility of a positive influence of expertise in the use of ultrasound on the first attempt success rate.	"

Our research results hint that having more experience with ultrasound might help make it more likely to succeed the first time, but we don't have enough proof to be sure."	It is also likely that ultrasound is more useful if the practitioner is experienced in its use.
24	Our results suggest, but do not confirm, that a possible advantage of ultrasound guidance for the first attempt success rate over other techniques is more pronounced in infants and small children than in older children.	"

Our research suggests that using ultrasound to guide medical procedures is especially helpful when doing them on infants and younger children, and it may be even more helpful than other techniques. However, our research does not prove this is true."	It is likely that ultrasound is more useful for infants and small children than for older children.
25	In people with acute ischaemic stroke, there was no significant difference between RIC and non-RIC for reducing stroke severity as assessed by the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score and the final infarct volume (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.24 mL, 95% CI -1.02 to 0.54; 2 trials, 175 participants, very low quality evidence).	"

In people who have had a stroke, there is no big difference between using a certain type of treatment (RIC) and not using it when it comes to reducing how bad the stroke is or how big the area affected by it (as measured by the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score and the final infarct volume)."	We found no significant differences in the size of the final stroke.
26	We analysed the effects of RIC on preventing and treating ischaemic stroke respectively.	"

We studied how RIC can help to stop and treat ischemic stroke."	Studies have suggested that RIC may have beneficial effects for preventing and treating ischaemic stroke.
27	There was no significant difference between RIC and non-RIC for improving the psychological impairment (SMD -0.37 points, 95% CI -1.15 to 0.41; 1 trial, 26 participants, very low quality evidence) and the cognitive impairment (SMD -0.26 points; 95% CI -0.72 to 0.21; 3 trials, 79 participants, low-quality evidence) in people with acute ischaemic stroke and cerebral small vessel disease.	"

This sentence is talking about two different groups of people who had strokes: those who received a type of treatment called RIC (RIC stands for Rehabilitation Intervention in Cerebrovascular Disease) and those who did not. It is talking about how the treatment affected their psychological and cognitive health. The results showed that there was not much difference between the two groups in terms of improving the psychological and cognitive health of the people with strokes."	In people with acute ischaemic stroke and chronic blood vessel disease of the brain, RIC did not affect measures of nerve function, mood, or thinking ability.
28	Adverse events associated with RIC were significantly higher in participants treated with RIC (RR 10.91; 95% CI 2.01 to 59.28; 3 trials, 371 participants, low-quality evidence), but no severe adverse event was attributable to RIC treatment.	"

Using RIC (a certain type of treatment) caused more bad events than other treatments, but none of the bad events were very serious."	Adverse events were significantly more common in the RIC group but were not reported to be severe.
29	Risk of bias varied across studies, with some studies lacking details of allocation concealment.	"

The amount of risk that the results of the studies could be influenced by something other than the facts was different for each study. Some studies didn't give enough information to make sure that people couldn't see which group the participants were in."	We noted variation in the risk of bias of included studies.
30	There were no serious adverse events related to either nitrous oxide or carbon dioxide pneumoperitoneum (three studies; 196 participants; very low quality of evidence).	"

The three studies done with 196 people showed that there were no bad effects from breathing either nitrogen gas or carbon dioxide gas during a medical procedure."	We are uncertain as to whether there are differences in the number of people with heart or lung complications or surgical complications between nitrous oxide and carbon dioxide.
31	Pressure ulcers, also known as bed sores, pressure sores or decubitus ulcers develop as a result of a localised injury to the skin or underlying tissue, or both.	"

Pressure ulcers are a type of sore that can form on your skin when you stay in one position for too long. They can be very painful and can cause damage to your skin and the tissue underneath it."	Pressure ulcers are also known as bed sores, pressure sores or decubitus ulcers.
32	Randomized controlled trials based on uniform and standard methods are needed.	"

Scientists need to do experiments using the same rules and methods so they can compare results."	Further research and well-designed studies are needed.
33	There is qualitative evidence that oral morphine has much the same efficacy as other available opioids.	"

Studies have shown that taking oral morphine is just as effective at treating pain as other types of medicine used to treat pain."	At one level these are good results.
34	To assess the benefits and harms of RIC for preventing ischaemic stroke and for treating people with ischaemic stroke and those at risk for ischaemic stroke.	"

This sentence is asking us to find out if a certain type of medical treatment (RIC) is helpful in preventing and treating strokes. We want to know if the benefits of using RIC are greater than the risks."	What are the benefits of using remote ischaemic conditioning (a noninvasive physical therapy that involves inflating blood pressure cuffs to reduce blood flow in arms and legs, and then releasing the affected blood around the body) in people with stroke or those at risk of stroke caused by low blood flow?
35	Our results suggest, but do not confirm, that a possible advantage of ultrasound guidance for the first attempt success rate over other techniques is more pronounced in infants and small children than in older children.	"

Our research suggests that using ultrasound to guide medical procedures is especially helpful when doing them on infants and younger children, and it may be even more helpful than other techniques. However, our research does not prove this is true."	It is likely that ultrasound is more useful for infants and small children than for older children.
36	Where results were reported for individual participants in 17 studies, 'no worse than mild pain' was achieved by 96% of participants (362/377), and an outcome equivalent to treatment success in 63% (400/638).	"

Out of the 17 studies that reported individual results, 96% of participants (362 out of 377) reported no more than mild pain, and 63% (400 out of 638) reported that their treatment was successful."	More than 9 in 10 participants had pain that went from moderate or severe before taking morphine to pain that was no worse than mild when taking morphine.
37	We searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Specialised Register up to 17 August 2017 through contact with the Information Specialist using search terms relevant to this review.	"

We asked an expert to help us look for information about a certain topic in a special database. We looked through the database until August 17, 2017, using words that were related to our topic."	We searched Cochrane Kidney and Transplant's Specialised Register up to 17 August 2017 and performed a systematic review of studies performed in patients with dysfunctional haemodialysis catheters and compared the success of thrombolytic agents, fibrin sheath stripping and line replacement.
38	Early and rapid emergence from anaesthesia is desirable for most neurosurgical patients.	"

It is best for patients who have had surgery on their brain if they wake up from the medicine that makes them go to sleep quickly and easily."	Smooth and quick awakening after surgery is important for these patients so that their mental status may be assessed easily.
39	The improved success rate at the first attempt may be more pronounced in infants and small children, in whom arterial line cannulation is more challenging than in older children.	"

The chance of being successful the first time is higher in babies and younger children than in older children when doctors try to put a tube into their artery. This is because it is harder to do in babies and younger children."	We found that ultrasound increased the rate of successful cannulation at the first attempt and reduced the formation of haematomas.
40	Pooled analyses for adverse events suggest lower risk of nausea and vomiting with propofol than with sevoflurane (risk ratio (RR) 0.68, 95% CI 0.51 to 0.91, low-quality evidence) or isoflurane (RR 0.45, 95% CI 0.26 to 0.78) and greater risk of haemodynamic changes with propofol than with sevoflurane (RR 1.85, 95% CI 1.07 to 3.17), but no differences in the risk of shivering or pain.	"

The results of many studies show that propofol is less likely to cause nausea or vomiting than sevoflurane, but is more likely to cause changes in the body's blood pressure than sevoflurane. There is no difference between propofol and sevoflurane when it comes to shivering or pain."	In terms of adverse effects, propofol was less likely to cause nausea and vomiting than either gas anaesthetic (about half as likely) but was more likely to be associated with changes in blood pressure.
41	Evidence from one trial of small sample size suggests that room air pneumoperitoneum may decrease hospital costs in people undergoing laparoscopic abdominal surgery.	"

This sentence is talking about a study that looked at a small group of people who had laparoscopic abdominal surgery, which is a type of operation done on the abdomen. The study found that using room air instead of a special gas during the operation may help to reduce the amount of money spent on the surgery."	Room air seemed to be associated with lower total hospital costs compared with carbon dioxide for insufflation of the abdominal cavity.
42	We reran the searches for all databases in March 2016, and when we update the review, we will deal with the two studies of interest found through this search that are awaiting classification.	"

We looked through all the different databases in March 2016, and when we look at the information again, we will decide what to do about two studies we found that we don't know enough about yet."	We reran the searches for all databases in March 2016 and found two studies that are awaiting classification.
43	Three trials randomised participants to nitrous oxide pneumoperitoneum (100 participants) or carbon dioxide pneumoperitoneum (96 participants).	"

This sentence describes a scientific experiment that tested two different types of medical treatments on two groups of people. The first group had 100 people and they were given a treatment with nitrous oxide. The second group had 96 people and they were given a treatment with carbon dioxide."	We identified nine clinical trials with 519 participants, of which three trials (196 participants) compared nitrous oxide (laughing gas) with carbon dioxide, five trials (177 participants) compared helium with carbon dioxide, and one trial (146 participants) compared room air with carbon dioxide.
44	There is no high quality evidence to support the use of anabolic steroids in treating pressure ulcers.	"

There is not enough good proof to show that using anabolic steroids can help people with pressure ulcers."	The trial was ended early as the trial authors deemed that the interim results suggested that there was unlikely to be a benefit from treatment with oxandrolone.
45	The quality of the current evidence is very low.	"

The information we have now is not very good."	Overall, the quality of the evidence for the results is very low.
46	Pressure ulcers, also known as bed sores, pressure sores or decubitus ulcers develop as a result of a localised injury to the skin or underlying tissue, or both.	"

A pressure ulcer is when your skin gets hurt from staying in the same place for too long. It is also sometimes called a bed sore, pressure sore, or decubitus ulcer. These kinds of skin injuries happen when you are not able to move around and change positions."	Lack of movement and sustained pressure on the skin over bony parts of the body such as the hips, heels, lower back and elbows can cause the skin to break down and an ulcer to form.
47	Pain relief did not differ between Mm/r and MIR.	"

The amount of pain relief that both Mm/r and MIR provided was the same."	This made it difficult to work out whether any one tablet or preparation of oral morphine was better than any other.
48	In people with carotid stenosis undergoing carotid stenting, there was no significant difference in the incidence of ischaemic stroke between participants treated with RIC and non-RIC (RR 0.22, 95% CI 0.01 to 4.03; 1 trial, 189 participants, low-quality evidence); however the stroke severity (assessed by infarct volume) was significantly lower in participants treated with RIC (mean difference (MD) -0.17 mL, 95% CI -0.23 to -0.11; 1 trial, 189 participants, low-quality evidence).	"

People with carotid stenosis (a narrowed artery in the neck) had a medical procedure called carotid stenting. In this procedure, some people received a special treatment called RIC (Remote Ischemic Conditioning). The study showed that there was no big difference in the number of people who had a stroke after the procedure between those who received RIC and those who did not. However, the study did show that people who received RIC had less severe strokes than those who did not receive RIC."	In people being treated with stenting (the insertion of a metal or plastic tube) for narrowed arteries in the neck, RIC may reduce the size of new brain injuries caused by reduced blood flow.
49	Thrombolysis, fibrin sheath disruption and over-the-wire catheter exchange are effective and appropriate therapies for immediately restoring catheter patency in dysfunctional cuffed and tunnelled HD catheters.	"

Thrombolysis, fibrin sheath disruption, and exchanging a catheter over a wire are good ways to quickly fix a catheter that isn't working properly in a person who has a cuffed and tunneled (covered) catheter in their body."	Thrombolytic therapy was probably better than placebo at restoring catheter function but there was no optimal dose or administration method.
50	Modified release versions of morphine were effective for 12- or 24-hour dosing depending on the formulation.	"

Morphine is a medicine that can be taken in a special form that helps people feel better for 12 or 24 hours depending on how it is made."	Modified release tablets are available that release morphine more slowly, so that they can be taken only twice a day or even only once a day.
51	To assess the effects of intravenous versus inhalational techniques for rapid emergence from anaesthesia in patients undergoing brain tumour surgery.	"

Doctors want to find out if it is better to give medicine to patients through a needle in the vein or through breathing in medicine to help them wake up quickly after surgery to remove a brain tumor."	We aimed to discover whether injectable techniques were better or worse than gaseous techniques.
52	There were three serious adverse events (subcutaneous emphysema) related to helium pneumoperitoneum (three studies; 128 participants; very low quality of evidence).	"

Three studies with 128 participants showed that serious health problems happened to some people when they had a procedure that involved helium gas being pumped into their stomach. The evidence of this happening was not very strong."	There were three serious side effects when helium was used.
53	Preclinical studies have suggested that RIC may have beneficial effects in ischaemic stroke patients and those at risk of ischaemic stroke.	"

Medical research has shown that a certain type of treatment called RIC may help people who have had a stroke or are at risk of having a stroke."	Studies have suggested that RIC may have beneficial effects for preventing and treating ischaemic stroke.
54	Based on the available evidence, physical disruption of a fibrin sheath using interventional radiology techniques appears to be equally efficacious as the use of a pharmaceutical thrombolytic agent for the immediate management of dysfunctional catheters (57 participants: RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.07).	"

Using a special medical technique (interventional radiology) to break apart a fibrin sheath seems to work just as well as using medicine (a thrombolytic agent) to help fix catheters that are not working properly. 57 people were studied and the results showed that the two methods were equally effective."	Physical disruption of a fibrin sheath may be equally effective as pharmaceutical thrombolytic agent for immediate management of catheter dysfunction.
55	We analysed the effects of RIC on preventing and treating ischaemic stroke respectively.	"

We studied how RIC can help to stop and treat ischemic stroke."	Studies have suggested that RIC may have beneficial effects for preventing and treating ischaemic stroke.
56	Anabolic steroids are considered because of their ability to stimulate protein synthesis and build muscle mass.	"

Anabolic steroids are used by some people because they are believed to help build muscles and increase the amount of protein in the body."	They are thought to promote the growth of skeletal muscle and to restore muscle mass, which could help pressure ulcers to heal.
57	Pain relief did not differ between Mm/r and MIR.	"

The amount of relief from pain was the same with Mm/r and MIR."	There did not seem to be much difference between them.
58	Brain tumour surgery usually is carried out with the patient under general anaesthesia.	"

Brain tumor surgery is usually done while the patient is asleep. The doctor gives the patient medicine to make them sleep so they can't feel the surgery."	Brain tumour surgery is carried out most often with the patient asleep and with the use of injectable agents or gases.
59	We included 15 RCTs with 1833 participants.	"

We found 15 studies that involved 1833 people to see if a certain treatment works."	We found 15 eligible studies with 1833 participants.
60	Moderate evidence showed that the fibrate class can be effective in the secondary prevention of composite outcome of non-fatal stroke, non-fatal MI, and vascular death.	"

Studies showed that taking a type of medicine called ""fibrate"" can help to prevent strokes, heart attacks, and death caused by blood vessels."	In combination with clofibrate data, quality of evidence was moderate for the composite (non-fatal stroke, non-fatal myocardial infarction (MI), and vascular death) and MI (non-fatal or fatal) outcomes and low for stroke (ischaemic or haemorrhagic, non-fatal or fatal) and death from vascular or any cause during the treatment and scheduled follow-up period.
61	Interventions included: thrombolytic therapy versus placebo (1 study); low versus high dose thrombolytic therapy (1); alteplase versus urokinase (1); short versus long thrombolytic dwell (1); thrombolytic therapy versus percutaneous fibrin sheath stripping (1); fibrin sheath stripping versus over-the-wire catheter exchange (1); and over-the-wire catheter exchange versus exchange with and without angioplasty sheath disruption (1).	"

This sentence is talking about different treatments for a medical condition. It lists seven different treatments, and then explains what each treatment is comparing. For example, the first treatment compares thrombolytic therapy (a type of medicine) with a placebo (a fake medicine). The second treatment compares a low dose of thrombolytic therapy with a high dose of it. The third treatment compares two different medicines, alteplase and urokinase. The fourth treatment compares a short treatment with a long one. The fifth treatment compares thrombolytic therapy with a procedure to remove a fibrin sheath. The sixth treatment compares a procedure to remove a fibrin sheath with a procedure to exchange a catheter. The seventh treatment compares a procedure to exchange a catheter with or without a procedure to widen a blood vessel."	Studies also compared drug dosages and methods of administration.
62	carbon dioxide, helium, argon, nitrogen, nitrous oxide, and room air) used for establishing pneumoperitoneum in participants undergoing laparoscopic general abdominal or gynaecological pelvic surgery.	"

These are different types of gases that are used in surgery to help doctors perform operations on the abdomen and pelvis."	What are the benefits and harms of various gases for insufflation (inflation with gas) of the abdominal (tummy) cavity to allow easier access to organs during laparoscopic (key-hole) abdominal surgery?
63	Therefore, other gases have been introduced as alternatives to carbon dioxide for establishing pneumoperitoneum.	"

Therefore, scientists are looking for new gases that can be used instead of carbon dioxide to make a person's abdomen full of air."	So, other gases have been suggested as alternatives to carbon dioxide.
64	On current data there is no evidence to support physical intervention over the use of pharmaceutical agents in the acute setting.	"

Based on what we know now, there is not enough evidence to show that it is better to use physical methods instead of medicine to treat someone in an emergency situation."	There is currently insufficient evidence favouring any technique in terms of either dialysis adequacy or reduced risk of adverse events.
65	Indigenous youth in particular commence smoking at an early age, and a disproportionate burden of substance-related morbidity and mortality exists as a result.	"

Young people who are from the original or earliest known inhabitants of an area, often start smoking earlier than other people, and this leads to more health problems and death than what is normal."	The associated harms to health are unacceptable.
66	The adverse events most commonly reported were mild and transient such as skin irritation, itching, burning, and stinging.	"

The most common side effects of this medicine were not serious. They were things like skin irritation, itching, burning, and stinging, but they were usually mild and did not last very long."	The side-effects reported most frequently by both participants and clinicians were dry, red, and sore skin.
67	For smokeless tobacco use, no difference was found between the skills-community arm and the control group at 42 weeks (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.67 to 1.30), though a significant difference was observed between the skills-only arm and the control group (RR 0.57, 95% CI 0.39 to 0.85).	"

This sentence is talking about a study that looked at the effects of using smokeless tobacco. The study found that there was no difference between the group of people who learned skills to help them not use smokeless tobacco and the group of people who did not get any help, after 42 weeks. But the study did find a difference between the group that only learned skills and the group that did not get any help; the group that only learned skills were less likely to use smokeless tobacco than the group that did not get any help."	Information from the two included studies in this review (1505 participants in total, in Native American communities) does not allow a conclusion to be drawn as to whether tobacco prevention programmes in Indigenous populations prevent Indigenous youth from smoking or using smokeless tobacco.
68	Preclinical studies have suggested that RIC may have beneficial effects in ischaemic stroke patients and those at risk of ischaemic stroke.	"

Medical research has shown that a certain type of treatment called RIC may help people who have had a stroke or are at risk of having a stroke."	Studies have suggested that RIC may have beneficial effects for preventing and treating ischaemic stroke.
69	Smoking prevalence in Indigenous youth is twice that of the non-Indigenous population, with tobacco experimentation commencing at an early age.	"

Indigenous (Native American) young people smoke twice as much as people who are not Native American, and they start trying cigarettes at a very young age."	Young people remain at particular risk of taking up smoking.
70	As an attempt to avoid possible detrimental effects on the oocytes from long exposure to sperm, the brief co-incubation insemination protocol was developed.	"

Scientists developed a special way of insemination to help prevent the eggs from being damaged from being around sperm for too long."	Shortening the co-incubation time of oocytes and sperm may possibly improve IVF outcomes by reducing the detrimental effect of ROS on the zygotes and the quality of the embryos.
71	We searched until January 2016.	"

We looked for something until the end of January 2016."	The evidence is current to January 2016.
72	A similar pattern was seen for DBP: three trials found a reduction in DBP (reductions ranged from -12.2 mmHg (95% CI -15.8 to -8.7) to -4.43 mmHg (95% CI -7.14 to -1.72)) and three trials found no clear evidence of a difference, however again with wide CIs.	"

In this study, there were three tests where people had a decrease in the amount of a certain type of blood pressure. The decrease ranged from -12.2 to -4.43. In the other three tests, there was no clear evidence of a change, but the results were uncertain."	Due to the small number of short-term studies and the variability between them, we were unable to determine conclusively whether or not tai chi was beneficial at reducing cardiovascular risk in healthy adults and adults at increased risk of CVD, although beneficial effects for CVD risk factors were seen in some studies.
73	Eight RCTs with 733 women in total that compared brief co-incubation and the standard insemination protocol were included.	"

Eight studies were done on 733 women to see if a different way of helping a woman get pregnant (called ""brief co-incubation"") works better than the usual way (called ""the standard insemination protocol"")."	This review identified eight randomized controlled trials involving 733 women.
74	We included all randomised clinical trials comparing box model trainers versus no training in surgical trainees with no prior laparoscopic experience.	"

We studied different types of surgical training to find out if it was helpful for people who had never done laparoscopic surgery before. We looked at people who used a type of practice called box model training and people who did not use any training."	The trials compared box model training versus no training (16 trials; 464 participants) or versus different types of box model training (14 trials; 382 participants) (some trials and participants were included in both comparisons as the trials compared different methods of box training versus no training).
75	We located 10 RCTs involving 2961 participating surgeons performing an operation in which the use of blunt needles was compared to the use of sharp needles.	"

This sentence is talking about a study that looked at 10 different groups of doctors who all did the same kind of surgery. In the study, they compared two different types of needles that the doctors used. One type of needle was ""blunt"" and the other type was ""sharp"". In total, 2961 doctors took part in the study."	We located 10 RCTs with 2961 operations in which blunt needles were compared to sharp needles.
76	To assess interventions used in the management of all types of melasma: epidermal, dermal, and mixed.	"

To figure out which treatments work best for melasma, which is a type of skin discoloration, we need to look at different kinds of melasma, like ones that are on the outer layer of the skin and ones that are deeper."	Epidermal melasma is the most superficial with an increase in the skin pigment (melanin) in the top layer of skin (epidermis).
77	We included three trials (involving 371 participants) in the analysis of the effects of RIC on ischaemic stroke prevention.	"

We looked at the effects of RIC on preventing strokes by running experiments with 371 people. We used the results of these experiments to help us understand the effects of RIC."	Three trials (involving 371 people) were eligible for our analysis of RIC for preventing ischaemic stroke, and another four trials (involving 364 people) were eligible for our analysis of RIC for treating ischaemic stroke.
78	They can be grouped into those including a bleaching agent such as hydroquinone, triple-combination creams (hydroquinone, tretinoin, and fluocinolone acetonide), and combination therapies (hydroquinone cream and glycolic acid peels), as well as less conventional therapies including rucinol, vitamin C iontophoresis, and skin-lightening complexes like Thiospot and Gigawhite.	"

There are different types of treatments for skin lightening. Some of these treatments use chemicals like hydroquinone, tretinoin, and fluocinolone acetonide. Other treatments include combinations of hydroquinone cream and glycolic acid peels, as well as other less conventional treatments like rucinol, vitamin C iontophoresis, and skin-lightening complexes like Thiospot and Gigawhite."	Some treatments incorporate a combination approach such as triple-combination cream (hydroquinone, tretinoin, and steroid).
79	Because the force needed for the blunt needles is higher, their use was rated as more difficult but still acceptable in five out of six studies.	"

Blunt needles are not easy to use, but in most studies, people said that it was okay."	Even though surgeons reported that the force needed for the blunt needles was higher, their use of the needles was still rated as acceptable in five out of six studies.
80	There appears to be no significant differences in the improvement of technical skills between different methods of box model training.	"

There does not seem to be much difference in how well people get better at using box models when using different methods of training."	There does not appear to be any significant differences in different methods of box model training.
81	The rates were 24.5 for the sponge and 10.9 for the diaphragm in the UK trial.	"

In the UK trial, it cost 24.5 pounds to buy a sponge and 10.9 pounds to buy a diaphragm."	For each 100 women who used the sponge for a year, about 25 got pregnant.
82	The contraceptive vaginal sponge was developed as an alternative to the contraceptive diaphragm.	"

The contraceptive vaginal sponge is a different kind of birth control that was created to give people another option besides using a contraceptive diaphragm."	The sponge contains a chemical to kill sperm.
83	Two trials met the inclusion criteria.	"

Two tests passed the standards that were set."	We found two trials.
84	Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the most frequent cause of death in people with early stages of chronic kidney disease (CKD), for whom the absolute risk of cardiovascular events is similar to people who have existing coronary artery disease.	"

People with early stages of chronic kidney disease have a high risk of getting a cardiovascular disease, which is a common cause of death. The risk of having a heart-related problem is the same for people with chronic kidney disease as it is for people who already have a heart problem."	Statins have some potential harmful effects on liver and muscle function, and some cancers.
85	To assess interventions used in the management of all types of melasma: epidermal, dermal, and mixed.	"

To figure out what treatments work best for the different types of melasma (a skin condition), like the kind that affects the top layer of skin, the kind that affects the layer below the top layer, and the kind that affects both layers."	Mixed melasma is a combination of epidermal and dermal melasma.
86	The use of blunt needles can reduce this risk because they don't penetrate skin easily but still perform sufficiently in other tissues.	"

Using needles that are not very sharp can help reduce the risk of getting hurt when giving a shot because they do not go through the skin easily, but still do the job in other parts of the body."	The use of blunt needles is proposed to prevent needle stick injuries.
87	High-quality randomised controlled trials on well-defined participants with long-term outcomes to determine the duration of response are needed.	"

We need to do experiments with a lot of people that have been carefully chosen, and follow up with them over a long time to find out how long the effects of something will last."	For example, studies should have a minimum follow-up period of 6 months and should clearly categorise participant groups such as age, type of melasma, and duration of the condition at the start of the trial so that these differences can be considered when assessing results.
88	There was considerable heterogeneity between the studies included in this review and studies were small and at some risk of bias.	"

The studies included in this review were very different from each other, and some of the studies were quite small and may not have been done very carefully."	Due to the small number of short-term studies and the variability between them, we were unable to determine conclusively whether or not tai chi was beneficial at reducing cardiovascular risk in healthy adults and adults at increased risk of CVD, although beneficial effects for CVD risk factors were seen in some studies.
89	Stress and a sedentary lifestyle are major determinants of cardiovascular disease (CVD).	"

Having a lot of stress and not exercising can lead to heart disease."	However, it is thought that CVD risk can be lowered by changing a number of modifiable behaviours including increasing levels of exercise, and relaxation to reduce stress levels, and both of these comprise tai chi.
90	All studies had at least one domain with unclear risk of bias, and some studies were at high risk of bias for allocation concealment (one study) and selective reporting (two studies).	"

This sentence is talking about different studies that were done. All the studies had something that was not clear about how reliable the results were. For some of the studies, it was hard to tell if the results were fair because of how the study was set up, and some of the studies were not reported on completely."	The results of this review should be treated with caution as the studies were small, of short duration and there was some risk of bias (where there was a risk of arriving at the wrong conclusions because of favouritism by the participants or researchers).
91	Surgeons and their assistants are especially at risk of exposure to blood due to glove perforations and needle stick injuries during operations.	"

Surgeons and the people who help them are more likely than other people to come into contact with blood, because sometimes their gloves and needles used during surgery can get holes in them."	This can lead to infection with HIV or other blood-borne viruses.
92	To compare the benefits and harms of box model training versus no training, another box model, animal model, or cadaveric model training for surgical trainees with no prior laparoscopic experience.	"

This sentence is asking if it is better to train medical students who have never done surgery before in a practice box, with no training, or if it is better to train them in a practice box, with another box, with an animal, or with a cadaver (dead body). It is trying to figure out which method is better for teaching medical students about surgery."	The impact of box model training in surgical trainees with no prior laparoscopic experience is unknown.
93	To assess the benefits and harms of RIC for preventing ischaemic stroke and for treating people with ischaemic stroke and those at risk for ischaemic stroke.	"

This sentence is asking us to find out if a certain type of medical treatment (RIC) is helpful in preventing and treating strokes. We want to know if the benefits of using RIC are greater than the risks."	What are the benefits of using remote ischaemic conditioning (a noninvasive physical therapy that involves inflating blood pressure cuffs to reduce blood flow in arms and legs, and then releasing the affected blood around the body) in people with stroke or those at risk of stroke caused by low blood flow?
94	Similarly, our results suggest, but do not confirm, the possibility of a positive influence of expertise in the use of ultrasound on the first attempt success rate.	"

Our research results hint that having more experience with ultrasound might help make it more likely to succeed the first time, but we don't have enough proof to be sure."	It is also likely that ultrasound is more useful if the practitioner is experienced in its use.
95	Such trials should assess the impacts of box model training on surgical skills in both the short and long term, as well as clinical outcomes when the trainee becomes competent to operate on patients.	"

This sentence is talking about research studies that are trying to find out if using a box model (a special type of practice tool) helps people learn how to do surgery in the short and long term, and if it helps them do the surgery correctly when they are ready to do it on real patients."	This suggests that the box model training improves technical skills of surgical trainees with no previous experience in laparoscopic surgery.
96	Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of blunt versus sharp suture needles for preventing needle stick injuries among surgical staff measured as glove perforations or self-reported needle stick injuries.	"

Scientists are comparing two types of needles to see which one is better at stopping medical staff from getting hurt. They are measuring how well the needles work by seeing if the gloves that the medical staff wear have been poked or if the medical staff report that they were stuck by a needle."	We included studies if they were randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of blunt versus sharp suture needles for preventing needle stick injuries among surgical staff.
97	In four studies, the use of blunt needles reduced the number of self-reported needle stick injuries with a RR of 0.31 (95% CI 0.14 to 0.68).	"

In four different studies, it was found that using blunt needles instead of sharp needles reduced the number of people who got hurt by needle sticks by a lot. The number of people who got hurt by needle sticks was 31% less than before."	In four studies the use of blunt needles also reduced the number of self-reported needle stick injuries by 69% (95% confidence interval 14% to 68%).
98	The quality of the evidence was rated as high.	"

The evidence was judged to be very good."	We concluded that there is high quality evidence that the use of blunt needles appreciably reduces the risk of contracting infectious diseases for surgeons and their assistants over a range of operations by reducing the number of needle stick injuries.
99	Results of the ongoing trials will add to the evidence base but additional longer-term, high-quality trials are needed.	"

The experiments that are happening now will give us more information, but we need to do more experiments that last longer and are very accurate."	Longer-term, high-quality trials are needed in order to determine the effectiveness of tai chi for CVD prevention.
