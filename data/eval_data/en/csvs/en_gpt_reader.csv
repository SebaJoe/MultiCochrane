Assess the good and bad of RIC for preventing, treating, and reducing risk of ischemic stroke."	What are the benefits of using remote ischaemic conditioning (a noninvasive physical therapy that involves inflating blood pressure cuffs to reduce blood flow in arms and legs, and then releasing the affected blood around the body) in people with stroke or those at risk of stroke caused by low blood flow?
5	We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing RIC with sham RIC or medical management in people with ischaemic stroke or at risk of ischaemic stroke.	"

We compared RIC with sham RIC or medical management in people with or at risk of ischaemic stroke using randomised controlled trials (RCTs)."	The studies compared RIC with sham RIC or medical management in people with ischaemic stroke or at risk of ischaemic stroke.
6	In people with symptomatic intracerebral artery stenosis, recurrent stroke was significantly reduced by RIC (risk ratio (RR) 0.32, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.12 to 0.83; 2 trials, 182 participants, low-quality evidence).	"

People with intracerebral artery stenosis had fewer strokes with RIC, according to 2 trials with 182 participants (low-quality evidence). RR 0.32, 95% CI 0.12â€“0.83."	In people with narrowing of arteries in the brain, RIC may reduce the risk of recurrent stroke.
7	Four RCTs compared ultrasound with palpation, and one compared ultrasound with Doppler auditory assistance.	"

Four RCTs compared ultrasound to palpation, and another tested ultrasound with Doppler auditory help."	We found five eligible studies - four comparing ultrasound with palpation and one comparing ultrasound with Doppler auditory assistance.

11	We included five RCTs reporting 444 arterial cannulations in paediatric participants.	"

We included five RCTs with 444 cannulations in kids."	We found five eligible studies - four comparing ultrasound with palpation and one comparing ultrasound with Doppler auditory assistance.
12	The improved success rate at the first attempt may be more pronounced in infants and small children, in whom arterial line cannulation is more challenging than in older children.	"

Infants and small children may see better success at first try with arterial line cannulation, which is more challenging than in older kids."	We found that ultrasound increased the rate of successful cannulation at the first attempt and reduced the formation of haematomas.
13	Meta-analysis showed that ultrasound guidance produces superior success rates at first attempt (risk ratio (RR) 1.96, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.34 to 2.85, 404 catheters, four RCTs, moderate-quality evidence) and fewer complications, such as haematoma formation (RR 0.20, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.60, 222 catheters, two RCTs, moderate-quality evidence).	"

Meta-analysis showed ultrasound guidance had significantly better success rates and fewer complications: 1.96 times more success and 0.20 times fewer complications, both with moderate-quality evidence."	We found that ultrasound increased the rate of successful cannulation at the first attempt and reduced the formation of haematomas.
14	We included three trials (involving 371 participants) in the analysis of the effects of RIC on ischaemic stroke prevention.	"

We analyzed 371 participants in 3 trials to study RIC's effect on stroke prevention."	Three trials (involving 371 people) were eligible for our analysis of RIC for preventing ischaemic stroke, and another four trials (involving 364 people) were eligible for our analysis of RIC for treating ischaemic stroke.
15	In people with carotid stenosis undergoing carotid stenting, there was no significant difference in the incidence of ischaemic stroke between participants treated with RIC and non-RIC (RR 0.22, 95% CI 0.01 to 4.03; 1 trial, 189 participants, low-quality evidence); however the stroke severity (assessed by infarct volume) was significantly lower in participants treated with RIC (mean difference (MD) -0.17 mL, 95% CI -0.23 to -0.11; 1 trial, 189 participants, low-quality evidence).	"

In people with carotid stenosis, treatment with RIC during carotid stenting showed no difference in stroke incidence, but stroke severity was lower. (1 trial, 189 participants, low-quality evidence)."	In people being treated with stenting (the insertion of a metal or plastic tube) for narrowed arteries in the neck, RIC may reduce the size of new brain injuries caused by reduced blood flow.
16	We rated the quality of evidence for all outcomes as moderate owing to imprecision due to wide confidence intervals, modest sample sizes and limited numbers of events.	"

We rated the evidence for all outcomes as moderate, due to wide confidence intervals, small sample sizes, and few events."	We rated the quality of evidence as moderate mainly because the number of studies was limited.
17	It usually involves restricting blood flow to limbs and then releasing the ischaemic blood to promote a neuroprotective effect.	"

Restricting blood flow to limbs and then releasing it can help protect the nervous system."	Remote ischaemic conditioning (RIC) is a strategy to protect and prevent damage to brain tissue by improving its ability to tolerate reduced blood flow.
18	In acute ischaemic stroke, for people receiving intravenous thrombolysis, the rate of death or dependency was significantly increased by RIC treatment compared with non-RIC treatment (RR 2.34; 95% 1.19 to 4.61; 1 trial, 285 participants, low-quality evidence).	"

People receiving intravenous thrombolysis for acute ischaemic stroke had a higher rate of death or dependency when receiving RIC treatment than those who didn't (RR 2.34; 95% 1.19 to 4.61; 285 participants, low-quality evidence)."	Among people with acute ischaemic stroke (where it had only been several hours from symptom onset) who received clot-dissolving medicines, we found that RIC may increase the risk of death or dependency (needing help from others).
19	In people with carotid stenosis undergoing carotid stenting, there was no significant difference in the incidence of ischaemic stroke between participants treated with RIC and non-RIC (RR 0.22, 95% CI 0.01 to 4.03; 1 trial, 189 participants, low-quality evidence); however the stroke severity (assessed by infarct volume) was significantly lower in participants treated with RIC (mean difference (MD) -0.17 mL, 95% CI -0.23 to -0.11; 1 trial, 189 participants, low-quality evidence).	"

In people with carotid stenosis treated with carotid stenting, there was no significant difference in stroke incidence between those treated with RIC and those with no RIC, but RIC treated patients had significantly lower stroke severity."	However, its effect on clinical outcomes (stroke and death) was unclear.
20	We included four trials (involving 364 participants) in the analysis of the effects of RIC on ischaemic stroke treatment.	"

We analyzed the effect of RIC on ischaemic stroke treatment with 4 trials and 364 participants."	Three trials (involving 371 people) were eligible for our analysis of RIC for preventing ischaemic stroke, and another four trials (involving 364 people) were eligible for our analysis of RIC for treating ischaemic stroke.
21	We also found improved success rates within two attempts (RR 1.78, 95% CI 1.25 to 2.51, 134 catheters, two RCTs, moderate-quality evidence) with ultrasound guidance compared with other types of guidance.	"

Ultrasound guidance had better success rates in two attempts than other guidance methods (moderate-quality evidence)."	Ultrasound also increased the success rate within two attempts.
22	We found low-quality evidence that RIC may reduce the risk of recurrent stroke in participants with intracerebral artery stenosis and reduce stroke severity in participants undergoing carotid stenting, but it may increase death or dependence in participants with acute ischaemic stroke who are undergoing intravenous thrombolysis.	"

RIC may reduce stroke risk and severity, but may increase death or dependence in acute ischaemic stroke patients receiving thrombolysis."	There is low-quality evidence which suggests that RIC may help prevent recurrent stroke in people with narrowed arteries in the brain, and may increase death or dependency in people with acute ischaemic stroke who received clot dissolving medication.
23	Similarly, our results suggest, but do not confirm, the possibility of a positive influence of expertise in the use of ultrasound on the first attempt success rate.	"

Results suggest expertise in ultrasound use may positively affect first attempt success rate."	It is also likely that ultrasound is more useful if the practitioner is experienced in its use.

"

There was no significant difference between RIC and non-RIC for reducing stroke severity in people with acute ischaemic stroke, according to National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score and final infarct volume (low quality evidence)."	We found no significant differences in the size of the final stroke.
26	We analysed the effects of RIC on preventing and treating ischaemic stroke respectively.	"

We studied how RIC helps prevent and treat ischemic stroke."	Studies have suggested that RIC may have beneficial effects for preventing and treating ischaemic stroke.
27	There was no significant difference between RIC and non-RIC for improving the psychological impairment (SMD -0.37 points, 95% CI -1.15 to 0.41; 1 trial, 26 participants, very low quality evidence) and the cognitive impairment (SMD -0.26 points; 95% CI -0.72 to 0.21; 3 trials, 79 participants, low-quality evidence) in people with acute ischaemic stroke and cerebral small vessel disease.	"

RIC and non-RIC had little effect on improving psychological and cognitive impairment in people with acute ischaemic stroke and cerebral small vessel disease, according to low quality evidence."	In people with acute ischaemic stroke and chronic blood vessel disease of the brain, RIC did not affect measures of nerve function, mood, or thinking ability.
28	Adverse events associated with RIC were significantly higher in participants treated with RIC (RR 10.91; 95% CI 2.01 to 59.28; 3 trials, 371 participants, low-quality evidence), but no severe adverse event was attributable to RIC treatment.	"

RIC treatment was linked to more adverse events, but none were serious."	Adverse events were significantly more common in the RIC group but were not reported to be severe.
29	Risk of bias varied across studies, with some studies lacking details of allocation concealment.	"

Studies had varying levels of risk, and some lacked details on concealing allocation."	We noted variation in the risk of bias of included studies.
30	There were no serious adverse events related to either nitrous oxide or carbon dioxide pneumoperitoneum (three studies; 196 participants; very low quality of evidence).	"

No serious side effects were found from either nitrous oxide or carbon dioxide pneumoperitoneum in 3 studies with 196 participants, but the evidence was of low quality."	We are uncertain as to whether there are differences in the number of people with heart or lung complications or surgical complications between nitrous oxide and carbon dioxide.

35	Our results suggest, but do not confirm, that a possible advantage of ultrasound guidance for the first attempt success rate over other techniques is more pronounced in infants and small children than in older children.	"

Ultrasound guidance for first attempt success rate may be more effective in infants and small children than in older kids, though this is yet to be confirmed."	It is likely that ultrasound is more useful for infants and small children than for older children.
36	Where results were reported for individual participants in 17 studies, 'no worse than mild pain' was achieved by 96% of participants (362/377), and an outcome equivalent to treatment success in 63% (400/638).	"

96% of participants (362 out of 377) experienced no worse than mild pain, and 63% (400 out of 638) achieved treatment success."	More than 9 in 10 participants had pain that went from moderate or severe before taking morphine to pain that was no worse than mild when taking morphine.
37	We searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Specialised Register up to 17 August 2017 through contact with the Information Specialist using search terms relevant to this review.	"

We searched for info on kidney and transplant issues up to Aug 17, 2017 with the help of a specialist, using the right search terms."	We searched Cochrane Kidney and Transplant's Specialised Register up to 17 August 2017 and performed a systematic review of studies performed in patients with dysfunctional haemodialysis catheters and compared the success of thrombolytic agents, fibrin sheath stripping and line replacement.

Infants and small children may see better success at first try with arterial line cannulation, which is more challenging than in older kids."	We found that ultrasound increased the rate of successful cannulation at the first attempt and reduced the formation of haematomas.
40	Pooled analyses for adverse events suggest lower risk of nausea and vomiting with propofol than with sevoflurane (risk ratio (RR) 0.68, 95% CI 0.51 to 0.91, low-quality evidence) or isoflurane (RR 0.45, 95% CI 0.26 to 0.78) and greater risk of haemodynamic changes with propofol than with sevoflurane (RR 1.85, 95% CI 1.07 to 3.17), but no differences in the risk of shivering or pain.	"

Studies of side effects suggest lower risk of nausea/vomiting with propofol than sevoflurane/isoflurane & greater risk of changes to blood flow with propofol than sevoflurane, but no difference in risk of shivering/pain."	In terms of adverse effects, propofol was less likely to cause nausea and vomiting than either gas anaesthetic (about half as likely) but was more likely to be associated with changes in blood pressure.
41	Evidence from one trial of small sample size suggests that room air pneumoperitoneum may decrease hospital costs in people undergoing laparoscopic abdominal surgery.	"

A trial suggests laparoscopic abdominal surgery with room air pneumoperitoneum may lower hospital costs."	Room air seemed to be associated with lower total hospital costs compared with carbon dioxide for insufflation of the abdominal cavity.

Evidence is poor."	Overall, the quality of the evidence for the results is very low.
46	Pressure ulcers, also known as bed sores, pressure sores or decubitus ulcers develop as a result of a localised injury to the skin or underlying tissue, or both.	"

Pressure ulcers, aka bed sores, can result from an injury to the skin or tissue."	Lack of movement and sustained pressure on the skin over bony parts of the body such as the hips, heels, lower back and elbows can cause the skin to break down and an ulcer to form.
47	Pain relief did not differ between Mm/r and MIR.	"

No difference in pain relief between Mm/r and MIR."	This made it difficult to work out whether any one tablet or preparation of oral morphine was better than any other.
48	In people with carotid stenosis undergoing carotid stenting, there was no significant difference in the incidence of ischaemic stroke between participants treated with RIC and non-RIC (RR 0.22, 95% CI 0.01 to 4.03; 1 trial, 189 participants, low-quality evidence); however the stroke severity (assessed by infarct volume) was significantly lower in participants treated with RIC (mean difference (MD) -0.17 mL, 95% CI -0.23 to -0.11; 1 trial, 189 participants, low-quality evidence).	"

In people with carotid stenosis, treatment with RIC during carotid stenting showed no difference in stroke incidence, but stroke severity was lower. (1 trial, 189 participants, low-quality evidence)."	In people being treated with stenting (the insertion of a metal or plastic tube) for narrowed arteries in the neck, RIC may reduce the size of new brain injuries caused by reduced blood flow.

Dysfunctional cuffed and tunnelled HD catheters can be fixed quickly with thrombolysis, fibrin sheath disruption, or catheter exchange."	Thrombolytic therapy was probably better than placebo at restoring catheter function but there was no optimal dose or administration method.
50	Modified release versions of morphine were effective for 12- or 24-hour dosing depending on the formulation.	"

Morphine in modified release versions worked for 12 or 24 hours, depending on its formulation."	Modified release tablets are available that release morphine more slowly, so that they can be taken only twice a day or even only once a day.
51	To assess the effects of intravenous versus inhalational techniques for rapid emergence from anaesthesia in patients undergoing brain tumour surgery.	"

Compare IV and inhaled anesthesia for faster recovery from brain tumor surgery."	We aimed to discover whether injectable techniques were better or worse than gaseous techniques.

"

Using either interventional radiology techniques or a pharmaceutical thrombolytic agent has been shown to be equally effective in quickly managing dysfunctional catheters in 57 participants (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.07)."	Physical disruption of a fibrin sheath may be equally effective as pharmaceutical thrombolytic agent for immediate management of catheter dysfunction.
55	We analysed the effects of RIC on preventing and treating ischaemic stroke respectively.	"

We studied how RIC helps prevent and treat ischemic stroke."	Studies have suggested that RIC may have beneficial effects for preventing and treating ischaemic stroke.
56	Anabolic steroids are considered because of their ability to stimulate protein synthesis and build muscle mass.	"

Studies showed that fibrates may help in preventing stroke, heart attack and vascular death."	In combination with clofibrate data, quality of evidence was moderate for the composite (non-fatal stroke, non-fatal myocardial infarction (MI), and vascular death) and MI (non-fatal or fatal) outcomes and low for stroke (ischaemic or haemorrhagic, non-fatal or fatal) and death from vascular or any cause during the treatment and scheduled follow-up period.
61	Interventions included: thrombolytic therapy versus placebo (1 study); low versus high dose thrombolytic therapy (1); alteplase versus urokinase (1); short versus long thrombolytic dwell (1); thrombolytic therapy versus percutaneous fibrin sheath stripping (1); fibrin sheath stripping versus over-the-wire catheter exchange (1); and over-the-wire catheter exchange versus exchange with and without angioplasty sheath disruption (1).	"

Six studies compared interventions such as thrombolytic therapy and placebo, different doses of thrombolytic therapy, alteplase and urokinase, short and long thrombolytic dwell times, thrombolytic therapy and percutaneous fibrin sheath stripping, fibrin sheath stripping and over-the-wire catheter exchange, and exchange with and without angioplasty sheath disruption."	Studies also compared drug dosages and methods of administration.
62	carbon dioxide, helium, argon, nitrogen, nitrous oxide, and room air) used for establishing pneumoperitoneum in participants undergoing laparoscopic general abdominal or gynaecological pelvic surgery.	"

Establishing pneumoperitoneum in those undergoing laparoscopic abdominal or pelvic surgery? Gas up with carbon dioxide, helium, argon, nitrogen, nitrous oxide, and room air."

63	Therefore, other gases have been introduced as alternatives to carbon dioxide for establishing pneumoperitoneum.	"

Replace carbon dioxide with other gases to create pneumoperitoneum."	So, other gases have been suggested as alternatives to carbon dioxide.
64	On current data there is no evidence to support physical intervention over the use of pharmaceutical agents in the acute setting.	"

No evidence suggests physical intervention is better than medication for acute conditions."	There is currently insufficient evidence favouring any technique in terms of either dialysis adequacy or reduced risk of adverse events.
65	Indigenous youth in particular commence smoking at an early age, and a disproportionate burden of substance-related morbidity and mortality exists as a result.	"

Indigenous youth start smoking young, causing a higher rate of substance-related health problems and deaths."	The associated harms to health are unacceptable.
66	The adverse events most commonly reported were mild and transient such as skin irritation, itching, burning, and stinging.	"

The most common side effects were mild and temporary, such as itchy, burning, and stinging skin irritation."	The side-effects reported most frequently by both participants and clinicians were dry, red, and sore skin.
67	For smokeless tobacco use, no difference was found between the skills-community arm and the control group at 42 weeks (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.67 to 1.30), though a significant difference was observed between the skills-only arm and the control group (RR 0.57, 95% CI 0.39 to 0.85).	"

At 42 weeks, no difference in smokeless tobacco use was found between the skills-community arm and the control group, but the skills-only arm showed a significant difference."	Information from the two included studies in this review (1505 participants in total, in Native American communities) does not allow a conclusion to be drawn as to whether tobacco prevention programmes in Indigenous populations prevent Indigenous youth from smoking or using smokeless tobacco.
68	Preclinical studies have suggested that RIC may have beneficial effects in ischaemic stroke patients and those at risk of ischaemic stroke.	"

Studies suggest RIC may help stroke and those at risk."	Studies have suggested that RIC may have beneficial effects for preventing and treating ischaemic stroke.

70	As an attempt to avoid possible detrimental effects on the oocytes from long exposure to sperm, the brief co-incubation insemination protocol was developed.	"

To avoid potential harm to oocytes from long exposure to sperm, the brief co-incubation insemination protocol was created."	Shortening the co-incubation time of oocytes and sperm may possibly improve IVF outcomes by reducing the detrimental effect of ROS on the zygotes and the quality of the embryos.
71	We searched until January 2016.	"

We searched till Jan. 2016."	The evidence is current to January 2016.
72	A similar pattern was seen for DBP: three trials found a reduction in DBP (reductions ranged from -12.2 mmHg (95% CI -15.8 to -8.7) to -4.43 mmHg (95% CI -7.14 to -1.72)) and three trials found no clear evidence of a difference, however again with wide CIs.	"

3 trials found a reduction in DBP (-12.2 to -4.43 mmHg) while 3 others found no clear difference, with wide CIs."	Due to the small number of short-term studies and the variability between them, we were unable to determine conclusively whether or not tai chi was beneficial at reducing cardiovascular risk in healthy adults and adults at increased risk of CVD, although beneficial effects for CVD risk factors were seen in some studies.
73	Eight RCTs with 733 women in total that compared brief co-incubation and the standard insemination protocol were included.	"

77	We included three trials (involving 371 participants) in the analysis of the effects of RIC on ischaemic stroke prevention.	"

We analyzed 371 participants in 3 trials to study RIC's effect on stroke prevention."	Three trials (involving 371 people) were eligible for our analysis of RIC for preventing ischaemic stroke, and another four trials (involving 364 people) were eligible for our analysis of RIC for treating ischaemic stroke.
78	They can be grouped into those including a bleaching agent such as hydroquinone, triple-combination creams (hydroquinone, tretinoin, and fluocinolone acetonide), and combination therapies (hydroquinone cream and glycolic acid peels), as well as less conventional therapies including rucinol, vitamin C iontophoresis, and skin-lightening complexes like Thiospot and Gigawhite.	"

Creams containing bleaching agents like hydroquinone, triple-combination creams, and combination therapies of hydroquinone and peels can lighten skin, as can unconventional treatments such as rucinol, vitamin C iontophoresis, and Thiospot and Gigawhite complexes."	Some treatments incorporate a combination approach such as triple-combination cream (hydroquinone, tretinoin, and steroid).
79	Because the force needed for the blunt needles is higher, their use was rated as more difficult but still acceptable in five out of six studies.	"

Blunt needles require more force, but 5 out of 6 studies found them acceptable to use."	Even though surgeons reported that the force needed for the blunt needles was higher, their use of the needles was still rated as acceptable in five out of six studies.
80	There appears to be no significant differences in the improvement of technical skills between different methods of box model training.	"

No significant differences in technical skill improvement seen with box model training methods."	There does not appear to be any significant differences in different methods of box model training.
81	The rates were 24.5 for the sponge and 10.9 for the diaphragm in the UK trial.	"

UK trial rates: sponge 24.5, diaphragm 10.9."	For each 100 women who used the sponge for a year, about 25 got pregnant.
82	The contraceptive vaginal sponge was developed as an alternative to the contraceptive diaphragm.	"

The vaginal sponge was created as an alternative to the diaphragm as contraception."	The sponge contains a chemical to kill sperm.
83	Two trials met the inclusion criteria.	"

Two trials qualified."	We found two trials.
84	Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the most frequent cause of death in people with early stages of chronic kidney disease (CKD), for whom the absolute risk of cardiovascular events is similar to people who have existing coronary artery disease.	"

CKD in early stages often leads to CVD, with a risk of cardiovascular events similar to those with existing coronary artery disease."	Statins have some potential harmful effects on liver and muscle function, and some cancers.
85	To assess interventions used in the management of all types of melasma: epidermal, dermal, and mixed.	"

Assessing interventions for managing all types of melasma: epidermal, dermal, and mixed."	Mixed melasma is a combination of epidermal and dermal melasma.
86	The use of blunt needles can reduce this risk because they don't penetrate skin easily but still perform sufficiently in other tissues.	"

Blunt needles reduce risk because they don't penetrate skin easily, yet still perform well in other tissues."	The use of blunt needles is proposed to prevent needle stick injuries.
87	High-quality randomised controlled trials on well-defined participants with long-term outcomes to determine the duration of response are needed.	"

More research is needed to determine how long a response will last, using high-quality trials with clear participants and long-term outcomes."	For example, studies should have a minimum follow-up period of 6 months and should clearly categorise participant groups such as age, type of melasma, and duration of the condition at the start of the trial so that these differences can be considered when assessing results.
88	There was considerable heterogeneity between the studies included in this review and studies were small and at some risk of bias.	"

Studies in this review showed great variation and were small, raising the risk of bias."	Due to the small number of short-term studies and the variability between them, we were unable to determine conclusively whether or not tai chi was beneficial at reducing cardiovascular risk in healthy adults and adults at increased risk of CVD, although beneficial effects for CVD risk factors were seen in some studies.
89	Stress and a sedentary lifestyle are major determinants of cardiovascular disease (CVD).	"

Stress and lack of exercise lead to CVD."	However, it is thought that CVD risk can be lowered by changing a number of modifiable behaviours including increasing levels of exercise, and relaxation to reduce stress levels, and both of these comprise tai chi.
90	All studies had at least one domain with unclear risk of bias, and some studies were at high risk of bias for allocation concealment (one study) and selective reporting (two studies).	"

At least one domain had unclear bias risk in all studies, and two studies had high risk of bias for selective reporting, and one for allocation concealment."	The results of this review should be treated with caution as the studies were small, of short duration and there was some risk of bias (where there was a risk of arriving at the wrong conclusions because of favouritism by the participants or researchers).
91	Surgeons and their assistants are especially at risk of exposure to blood due to glove perforations and needle stick injuries during operations.	"

Surgeons and their staff face blood exposure risks due to torn gloves and needle wounds during operations."	This can lead to infection with HIV or other blood-borne viruses.
92	To compare the benefits and harms of box model training versus no training, another box model, animal model, or cadaveric model training for surgical trainees with no prior laparoscopic experience.	"

Comparing the pros and cons of box model training for surgical trainees with no prior laparoscopic experience to no training, another box model, animal model, or cadaveric model training."	The impact of box model training in surgical trainees with no prior laparoscopic experience is unknown.
93	To assess the benefits and harms of RIC for preventing ischaemic stroke and for treating people with ischaemic stroke and those at risk for ischaemic stroke.	"

Assess the good and bad of RIC for preventing, treating, and reducing risk of ischemic stroke."	What are the benefits of using remote ischaemic conditioning (a noninvasive physical therapy that involves inflating blood pressure cuffs to reduce blood flow in arms and legs, and then releasing the affected blood around the body) in people with stroke or those at risk of stroke caused by low blood flow?
94	Similarly, our results suggest, but do not confirm, the possibility of a positive influence of expertise in the use of ultrasound on the first attempt success rate.	"

Results suggest expertise in ultrasound use may positively affect first attempt success rate."	It is also likely that ultrasound is more useful if the practitioner is experienced in its use.
95	Such trials should assess the impacts of box model training on surgical skills in both the short and long term, as well as clinical outcomes when the trainee becomes competent to operate on patients.	"

Trials should evaluate how box model training affects surgical skills over time and patient outcomes when the trainee is proficient."	This suggests that the box model training improves technical skills of surgical trainees with no previous experience in laparoscopic surgery.
96	Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of blunt versus sharp suture needles for preventing needle stick injuries among surgical staff measured as glove perforations or self-reported needle stick injuries.	"

Randomised trials compared blunt and sharp needles for preventing needle stick injuries among surgical staff, measured by glove perforations or self-reported injuries."	We included studies if they were randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of blunt versus sharp suture needles for preventing needle stick injuries among surgical staff.
97	In four studies, the use of blunt needles reduced the number of self-reported needle stick injuries with a RR of 0.31 (95% CI 0.14 to 0.68).	"

Using blunt needles cut the number of self-reported needle stick injuries by 69%, according to 4 studies."	In four studies the use of blunt needles also reduced the number of self-reported needle stick injuries by 69% (95% confidence interval 14% to 68%).
98	The quality of the evidence was rated as high.	"

The evidence was of high quality."	We concluded that there is high quality evidence that the use of blunt needles appreciably reduces the risk of contracting infectious diseases for surgeons and their assistants over a range of operations by reducing the number of needle stick injuries.
99	Results of the ongoing trials will add to the evidence base but additional longer-term, high-quality trials are needed.	"

More trials are required to build a stronger evidence base, as results of ongoing trials will add to it."	Longer-term, high-quality trials are needed in order to determine the effectiveness of tai chi for CVD prevention.
