9	The improved success rate at the first attempt may be more pronounced in infants and small children, in whom arterial line cannulation is more challenging than in older children.	This trial appears to increase the chance of death in infants or young young children, in whom arterial line cannulation is more challenging than in older children.	It is likely that ultrasound is more useful for infants and small children than for older children.		10.1002/14651858.CD011364.pub2
10	We searched the Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register (16 January 2018), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2017, Issue 12) in the Cochrane Library (January 2018), MEDLINE Ovid (1946 to January 2018), Embase Ovid (1974 to January 2018), Web of Science Core Collection (1950 to January 2018) and three Chinese databases (January 2018).

11	We included five RCTs reporting 444 arterial cannulations in paediatric participants.	We included five studies (with 444 blood pressure to prevent the development of stiffness within the blood vessels) of active arterial cannulas in paediatric participants.	We found five eligible studies - four comparing ultrasound with palpation and one comparing ultrasound with Doppler auditory assistance.		10.1002/14651858.CD011364.pub2
12	The improved success rate at the first attempt may be more pronounced in infants and small children, in whom arterial line cannulation is more challenging than in older children.	Some people involved older men, in whom arterial line cannulation means more difficult to respond to the emergency department.	We found that ultrasound increased the rate of successful cannulation at the first attempt and reduced the formation of haematomas.		10.1002/14651858.CD011364.pub2
13	Meta-analysis showed that ultrasound guidance produces superior success rates at first attempt (risk ratio (RR) 1.96, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.34 to 2.85, 404 catheters, four RCTs, moderate-quality evidence) and fewer complications, such as haematoma formation (RR 0.20, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.60, 222 catheters, two RCTs, moderate-quality evidence).	Ultrasound guidance produces superior success rates at first attempt and fewer complications (such as haematoma formation.	We found that ultrasound increased the rate of successful cannulation at the first attempt and reduced the formation of haematomas.		10.1002/14651858.CD011364.pub2
14	We included three trials (involving 371 participants) in the analysis of the effects of RIC on ischaemic stroke prevention.	We included three randomised clinical trials, with a total of 371 participants.	Three trials (involving 371 people) were eligible for our analysis of RIC for preventing ischaemic stroke, and another four trials (involving 364 people) were eligible for our analysis of RIC for treating ischaemic stroke.		10.1002/14651858.CD012503.pub2
15	In people with carotid stenosis undergoing carotid stenting, there was no significant difference in the incidence of ischaemic stroke between participants treated with RIC and non-RIC (RR 0.22, 95% CI 0.01 to 4.03; 1 trial, 189 participants, low-quality evidence); however the stroke severity (assessed by infarct volume) was significantly lower in participants treated with RIC (mean difference (MD) -0.17 mL, 95% CI -0.23 to -0.11; 1 trial, 189 participants, low-quality evidence).	In people with carotid stenosis undergoing course of operation, there was no significant difference in the risk of stroke or stroke severity between people with non-RIC and non-ric.	In people being treated with stenting (the insertion of a metal or plastic tube) for narrowed arteries in the neck, RIC may reduce the size of new brain injuries caused by reduced blood flow.		10.1002/14651858.CD012503.pub2
16	We rated the quality of evidence for all outcomes as moderate owing to imprecision due to wide confidence intervals, modest sample sizes and limited numbers of events.

18	In acute ischaemic stroke, for people receiving intravenous thrombolysis, the rate of death or dependency was significantly increased by RIC treatment compared with non-RIC treatment (RR 2.34; 95% 1.19 to 4.61; 1 trial, 285 participants, low-quality evidence).	In people receiving non-RIC treatment, the rate of death or dependency was significantly increased by RIC treatment compared with non-RIC treatment.	Among people with acute ischaemic stroke (where it had only been several hours from symptom onset) who received clot-dissolving medicines, we found that RIC may increase the risk of death or dependency (needing help from others).		10.1002/14651858.CD012503.pub2
19	In people with carotid stenosis undergoing carotid stenting, there was no significant difference in the incidence of ischaemic stroke between participants treated with RIC and non-RIC (RR 0.22, 95% CI 0.01 to 4.03; 1 trial, 189 participants, low-quality evidence); however the stroke severity (assessed by infarct volume) was significantly lower in participants treated with RIC (mean difference (MD) -0.17 mL, 95% CI -0.23 to -0.11; 1 trial, 189 participants, low-quality evidence).	We found that stroke severity was significantly lower in people with carotid stenosis at all time points.	However, its effect on clinical outcomes (stroke and death) was unclear.		10.1002/14651858.CD012503.pub2
20	We included four trials (involving 364 participants) in the analysis of the effects of RIC on ischaemic stroke treatment.	Key results of trials of a total of 365 participants assessed the effects of RIC on stroke-related symptoms.	Three trials (involving 371 people) were eligible for our analysis of RIC for preventing ischaemic stroke, and another four trials (involving 364 people) were eligible for our analysis of RIC for treating ischaemic stroke.		10.1002/14651858.CD012503.pub2
21	We also found improved success rates within two attempts (RR 1.78, 95% CI 1.25 to 2.51, 134 catheters, two RCTs, moderate-quality evidence) with ultrasound guidance compared with other types of guidance.	We also found results from two studies that compared ultrasound with other methods of guidance.	Ultrasound also increased the success rate within two attempts.		10.1002/14651858.CD011364.pub2
22	We found low-quality evidence that RIC may reduce the risk of recurrent stroke in participants with intracerebral artery stenosis and reduce stroke severity in participants undergoing carotid stenting, but it may increase death or dependence in participants with acute ischaemic stroke who are undergoing intravenous thrombolysis.	The risk of stroke severity among participants in the brain by sixteen strokes is too small.	There is low-quality evidence which suggests that RIC may help prevent recurrent stroke in people with narrowed arteries in the brain, and may increase death or dependency in people with acute ischaemic stroke who received clot dissolving medication.		10.1002/14651858.CD012503.pub2

25	In people with acute ischaemic stroke, there was no significant difference between RIC and non-RIC for reducing stroke severity as assessed by the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score and the final infarct volume (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.24 mL, 95% CI -1.02 to 0.54; 2 trials, 175 participants, very low quality evidence).	Scale of the level of stroke compared with non-RIC, there were very low quality evidence that the results on the final stroke severity measured by the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score and the final infarct volume of the blood (very low quality evidence).

27	There was no significant difference between RIC and non-RIC for improving the psychological impairment (SMD -0.37 points, 95% CI -1.15 to 0.41; 1 trial, 26 participants, very low quality evidence) and the cognitive impairment (SMD -0.26 points; 95% CI -0.72 to 0.21; 3 trials, 79 participants, low-quality evidence) in people with acute ischaemic stroke and cerebral small vessel disease.	There was also no difference between interventions for the psychological impairment (low-quality evidence) and cognitive impairment (low quality evidence).	In people with acute ischaemic stroke and chronic blood vessel disease of the brain, RIC did not affect measures of nerve function, mood, or thinking ability.		10.1002/14651858.CD012503.pub2
28	Adverse events associated with RIC were significantly higher in participants treated with RIC (RR 10.91; 95% CI 2.01 to 59.28; 3 trials, 371 participants, low-quality evidence), but no severe adverse event was attributable to RIC treatment.

40	Pooled analyses for adverse events suggest lower risk of nausea and vomiting with propofol than with sevoflurane (risk ratio (RR) 0.68, 95% CI 0.51 to 0.91, low-quality evidence) or isoflurane (RR 0.45, 95% CI 0.26 to 0.78) and greater risk of haemodynamic changes with propofol than with sevoflurane (RR 1.85, 95% CI 1.07 to 3.17), but no differences in the risk of shivering or pain.	Pooled analyses for adverse events suggest that the safety of the medication using propofol is lower in a single topical corticosteroid alone compared with shivering strategies.	In terms of adverse effects, propofol was less likely to cause nausea and vomiting than either gas anaesthetic (about half as likely) but was more likely to be associated with changes in blood pressure.		10.1002/14651858.CD010467.pub2
41	Evidence from one trial of small sample size suggests that room air pneumoperitoneum may decrease hospital costs in people undergoing laparoscopic abdominal surgery.

Mixed melasma is a combination of epidermal and dermal melasma.		10.1002/14651858.CD003583.pub2
86	The use of blunt needles can reduce this risk because they don't penetrate skin easily but still perform sufficiently in other tissues.	Thus, a result of blunt needles can reduce the risk of developing a infection.	The use of blunt needles is proposed to prevent needle stick injuries.		10.1002/14651858.CD009170.pub2
87	High-quality randomised controlled trials on well-defined participants with long-term outcomes to determine the duration of response are needed.	More randomised trials compared well-defined participants with long-term outcomes determine the duration of response are needed.	For example, studies should have a minimum follow-up period of 6 months and should clearly categorise participant groups such as age, type of melasma, and duration of the condition at the start of the trial so that these differences can be considered when assessing results.		10.1002/14651858.CD003583.pub2
88	There was considerable heterogeneity between the studies included in this review and studies were small and at some risk of bias.	There were small studies with limited quality.	Due to the small number of short-term studies and the variability between them, we were unable to determine conclusively whether or not tai chi was beneficial at reducing cardiovascular risk in healthy adults and adults at increased risk of CVD, although beneficial effects for CVD risk factors were seen in some studies.		10.1002/14651858.CD010366.pub2
89	Stress and a sedentary lifestyle are major determinants of cardiovascular disease (CVD).	Stress and a sedentary lifestyle are large controlled complication of high blood pressure.	However, it is thought that CVD risk can be lowered by changing a number of modifiable behaviours including increasing levels of exercise, and relaxation to reduce stress levels, and both of these comprise tai chi.		10.1002/14651858.CD010366.pub2
90	All studies had at least one domain with unclear risk of bias, and some studies were at high risk of bias for allocation concealment (one study) and selective reporting (two studies).	Although many studies had at high risk of bias, a stiffness was reduced with some studies at high risk of bias when allocation concealment (one study) and selective reporting (two studies).	The results of this review should be treated with caution as the studies were small, of short duration and there was some risk of bias (where there was a risk of arriving at the wrong conclusions because of favouritism by the participants or researchers).		10.1002/14651858.CD010366.pub2
91	Surgeons and their assistants are especially at risk of exposure to blood due to glove perforations and needle stick injuries during operations.
