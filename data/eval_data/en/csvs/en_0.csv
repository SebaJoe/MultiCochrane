0	Our results suggest, but do not confirm, that a possible advantage of ultrasound guidance for the first attempt success rate over other techniques is more pronounced in infants and small children than in older children.	Ultrasound guidance is more pronounced when used for improving the success rate among infants and small children than at older children.	Our evidence suggests that ultrasound is superior to other techniques for arterial catheter insertion, particularly in babies and young children.		10.1002/14651858.CD011364.pub2
1	We included seven trials, involving 735 participants, in this review.	We included seven randomised controlled trials with a total of 135 participants in this review, with our review included seven studies, which were from totals all published research published up to December 2015 and included randomized controlled trials, which included either randomisation spending in the Cochrane review.	This review included seven studies (specifically randomised controlled trials), involving 735 people.		10.1002/14651858.CD012503.pub2

3	Remote ischaemic conditioning (RIC) has been developed as a neuroprotective strategy to prevent and treat ischaemic stroke.	remote ischaemic conditioning is a neuroprotective strategy to prevent or treat ischaemic stroke.	Remote ischaemic conditioning (RIC) is a strategy to protect and prevent damage to brain tissue by improving its ability to tolerate reduced blood flow.		10.1002/14651858.CD012503.pub2
4	To assess the benefits and harms of RIC for preventing ischaemic stroke and for treating people with ischaemic stroke and those at risk for ischaemic stroke.	More studies are needed to assess the benefits and harms ofric therapy to prevent ischaemic stroke in people with ischaemic stroke.	What are the benefits of using remote ischaemic conditioning (a noninvasive physical therapy that involves inflating blood pressure cuffs to reduce blood flow in arms and legs, and then releasing the affected blood around the body) in people with stroke or those at risk of stroke caused by low blood flow?		10.1002/14651858.CD012503.pub2
5	We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing RIC with sham RIC or medical management in people with ischaemic stroke or at risk of ischaemic stroke.	We reviewed the evidence about the effect of drugs that are applied to stroke prevention or in improving heart rhythm (rhythm control) and stroke risk.	The studies compared RIC with sham RIC or medical management in people with ischaemic stroke or at risk of ischaemic stroke.		10.1002/14651858.CD012503.pub2
6	In people with symptomatic intracerebral artery stenosis, recurrent stroke was significantly reduced by RIC (risk ratio (RR) 0.32, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.12 to 0.83; 2 trials, 182 participants, low-quality evidence).	Compared to other antipsychotic drugs, recurrent stroke was significantly reduced by recurrent stroke.	In people with narrowing of arteries in the brain, RIC may reduce the risk of recurrent stroke.		10.1002/14651858.CD012503.pub2
7	Four RCTs compared ultrasound with palpation, and one compared ultrasound with Doppler auditory assistance.	A third RCT compared the use of ultrasound to the Doppler auditory and found that ultrasound could be less effective than CTG.	We found five eligible studies - four comparing ultrasound with palpation and one comparing ultrasound with Doppler auditory assistance.		10.1002/14651858.CD011364.pub2
8	Preclinical studies have suggested that RIC may have beneficial effects in ischaemic stroke patients and those at risk of ischaemic stroke.	We conclude that people receiving cardiomyoglycaemic stroke may benefit from interventions to their heart and stroke.	Studies have suggested that RIC may have beneficial effects for preventing and treating ischaemic stroke.		10.1002/14651858.CD012503.pub2
9	The improved success rate at the first attempt may be more pronounced in infants and small children, in whom arterial line cannulation is more challenging than in older children.	These strategies are sometimes prescribed as very challenging in older children.	It is likely that ultrasound is more useful for infants and small children than for older children.		10.1002/14651858.CD011364.pub2
10	We searched the Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register (16 January 2018), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2017, Issue 12) in the Cochrane Library (January 2018), MEDLINE Ovid (1946 to January 2018), Embase Ovid (1974 to January 2018), Web of Science Core Collection (1950 to January 2018) and three Chinese databases (January 2018).	We searched the medical literature for clinical trials in which people with stroke were randomly assigned to one of two or more classes of medication for stroke, but this was not conclusive.	The results of this review are current up to January 2018.		10.1002/14651858.CD012503.pub2
11	We included five RCTs reporting 444 arterial cannulations in paediatric participants.	We included five trials reporting 444 arterial cannulations in paediatric people.	We found five eligible studies - four comparing ultrasound with palpation and one comparing ultrasound with Doppler auditory assistance.		10.1002/14651858.CD011364.pub2
12	The improved success rate at the first attempt may be more pronounced in infants and small children, in whom arterial line cannulation is more challenging than in older children.	Children are more likely to experience a higher frequency of arterial line cannulation during the first attempt.	We found that ultrasound increased the rate of successful cannulation at the first attempt and reduced the formation of haematomas.		10.1002/14651858.CD011364.pub2
13	Meta-analysis showed that ultrasound guidance produces superior success rates at first attempt (risk ratio (RR) 1.96, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.34 to 2.85, 404 catheters, four RCTs, moderate-quality evidence) and fewer complications, such as haematoma formation (RR 0.20, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.60, 222 catheters, two RCTs, moderate-quality evidence).	We found that ultrasound guidance produces superior success rate at first attempt and fewer complications, such as haematoma formation.	We found that ultrasound increased the rate of successful cannulation at the first attempt and reduced the formation of haematomas.		10.1002/14651858.CD011364.pub2
14	We included three trials (involving 371 participants) in the analysis of the effects of RIC on ischaemic stroke prevention.	We included three trials with 373 participants and provided one trial with seven trials involving 373 participants.	Three trials (involving 371 people) were eligible for our analysis of RIC for preventing ischaemic stroke, and another four trials (involving 364 people) were eligible for our analysis of RIC for treating ischaemic stroke.		10.1002/14651858.CD012503.pub2
15	In people with carotid stenosis undergoing carotid stenting, there was no significant difference in the incidence of ischaemic stroke between participants treated with RIC and non-RIC (RR 0.22, 95% CI 0.01 to 4.03; 1 trial, 189 participants, low-quality evidence); however the stroke severity (assessed by infarct volume) was significantly lower in participants treated with RIC (mean difference (MD) -0.17 mL, 95% CI -0.23 to -0.11; 1 trial, 189 participants, low-quality evidence).	One study provided no significant difference in the incidence of ischaemic stroke between the patients treated with or without the use of the rehabilitation technique.	In people being treated with stenting (the insertion of a metal or plastic tube) for narrowed arteries in the neck, RIC may reduce the size of new brain injuries caused by reduced blood flow.		10.1002/14651858.CD012503.pub2
16	We rated the quality of evidence for all outcomes as moderate owing to imprecision due to wide confidence intervals, modest sample sizes and limited numbers of events.	We rated the quality of evidence provided by included studies as moderate owing to imprecision as wide confidence intervals, modest sample sizes and limited numbers of events.	We rated the quality of evidence as moderate mainly because the number of studies was limited.		10.1002/14651858.CD011364.pub2

18	In acute ischaemic stroke, for people receiving intravenous thrombolysis, the rate of death or dependency was significantly increased by RIC treatment compared with non-RIC treatment (RR 2.34; 95% 1.19 to 4.61; 1 trial, 285 participants, low-quality evidence).	In acute ischaemic stroke, for patients receiving intravenous thrombolysis, the rate of death or dependency was significantly increased by RIC treatment compared with non-ricotherapy.	Among people with acute ischaemic stroke (where it had only been several hours from symptom onset) who received clot-dissolving medicines, we found that RIC may increase the risk of death or dependency (needing help from others).		10.1002/14651858.CD012503.pub2
19	In people with carotid stenosis undergoing carotid stenting, there was no significant difference in the incidence of ischaemic stroke between participants treated with RIC and non-RIC (RR 0.22, 95% CI 0.01 to 4.03; 1 trial, 189 participants, low-quality evidence); however the stroke severity (assessed by infarct volume) was significantly lower in participants treated with RIC (mean difference (MD) -0.17 mL, 95% CI -0.23 to -0.11; 1 trial, 189 participants, low-quality evidence).	Our results showed that probably there was no difference in the incidence of ischaemic stroke in people undergoing carotid stenting.	However, its effect on clinical outcomes (stroke and death) was unclear.		10.1002/14651858.CD012503.pub2
20	We included four trials (involving 364 participants) in the analysis of the effects of RIC on ischaemic stroke treatment.	We included four trials (involving 364 participants) in this review.	Three trials (involving 371 people) were eligible for our analysis of RIC for preventing ischaemic stroke, and another four trials (involving 364 people) were eligible for our analysis of RIC for treating ischaemic stroke.		10.1002/14651858.CD012503.pub2
21	We also found improved success rates within two attempts (RR 1.78, 95% CI 1.25 to 2.51, 134 catheters, two RCTs, moderate-quality evidence) with ultrasound guidance compared with other types of guidance.	We also found improved success rates within two attempts (low-quality evidence).	Ultrasound also increased the success rate within two attempts.		10.1002/14651858.CD011364.pub2
22	We found low-quality evidence that RIC may reduce the risk of recurrent stroke in participants with intracerebral artery stenosis and reduce stroke severity in participants undergoing carotid stenting, but it may increase death or dependence in participants with acute ischaemic stroke who are undergoing intravenous thrombolysis.	They found that the relative effectiveness of high-dose radiotherapy may reduce the risk of recurrent stroke and reduce stroke severity.	There is low-quality evidence which suggests that RIC may help prevent recurrent stroke in people with narrowed arteries in the brain, and may increase death or dependency in people with acute ischaemic stroke who received clot dissolving medication.		10.1002/14651858.CD012503.pub2
23	Similarly, our results suggest, but do not confirm, the possibility of a positive influence of expertise in the use of ultrasound on the first attempt success rate.	We also indicate that ultrasound may also have some benefit for the initial attempt success rate; however, its results were not confirmed.	It is also likely that ultrasound is more useful if the practitioner is experienced in its use.		10.1002/14651858.CD011364.pub2
24	Our results suggest, but do not confirm, that a possible advantage of ultrasound guidance for the first attempt success rate over other techniques is more pronounced in infants and small children than in older children.	For people with asthma and older infants (infants and small children) at high-income countries, ultrasound guidance is associated with the first attempt success rate.	It is likely that ultrasound is more useful for infants and small children than for older children.		10.1002/14651858.CD011364.pub2
25	In people with acute ischaemic stroke, there was no significant difference between RIC and non-RIC for reducing stroke severity as assessed by the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score and the final infarct volume (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.24 mL, 95% CI -1.02 to 0.54; 2 trials, 175 participants, very low quality evidence).	Two studies compared almost half of patients who had a heart attack (high blood pressure) on the stroke severity, which was not evident in patients treated with non-ric for reducing stroke severity.	We found no significant differences in the size of the final stroke.		10.1002/14651858.CD012503.pub2
26	We analysed the effects of RIC on preventing and treating ischaemic stroke respectively.	We are uncertain whether the effects of high-dose antihypertensive drugs (DICs) on preventing and treating ischaemic stroke.	Studies have suggested that RIC may have beneficial effects for preventing and treating ischaemic stroke.		10.1002/14651858.CD012503.pub2
27	There was no significant difference between RIC and non-RIC for improving the psychological impairment (SMD -0.37 points, 95% CI -1.15 to 0.41; 1 trial, 26 participants, very low quality evidence) and the cognitive impairment (SMD -0.26 points; 95% CI -0.72 to 0.21; 3 trials, 79 participants, low-quality evidence) in people with acute ischaemic stroke and cerebral small vessel disease.	We found no evidence to indicate that cognitive impairment in people with acute ischaemic stroke and cognitive impairment are better than non-ric for acute ischaemic stroke.	In people with acute ischaemic stroke and chronic blood vessel disease of the brain, RIC did not affect measures of nerve function, mood, or thinking ability.		10.1002/14651858.CD012503.pub2
28	Adverse events associated with RIC were significantly higher in participants treated with RIC (RR 10.91; 95% CI 2.01 to 59.28; 3 trials, 371 participants, low-quality evidence), but no severe adverse event was attributable to RIC treatment.	Three trials (373 participants) found higher side effects in people with the treatment of risperidone (a major adverse event).	Adverse events were significantly more common in the RIC group but were not reported to be severe.		10.1002/14651858.CD012503.pub2
29	Risk of bias varied across studies, with some studies lacking details of allocation concealment.	Risk of bias varied across studies, with some studies lacking details of allocation concealment.	We noted variation in the risk of bias of included studies.		10.1002/14651858.CD011364.pub2
30	There were no serious adverse events related to either nitrous oxide or carbon dioxide pneumoperitoneum (three studies; 196 participants; very low quality of evidence).	There were no serious adverse events.	We are uncertain as to whether there are differences in the number of people with heart or lung complications or surgical complications between nitrous oxide and carbon dioxide.		10.1002/14651858.CD009569.pub3

32	Randomized controlled trials based on uniform and standard methods are needed.	There is not enough evidence available to draw reliable conclusions for inclusion in the review.	Further research and well-designed studies are needed.		10.1002/14651858.CD010467.pub2
33	There is qualitative evidence that oral morphine has much the same efficacy as other available opioids.	It is not clear if oral morphine is as effective as other available opioids.	At one level these are good results.		10.1002/14651858.CD003868.pub4
34	To assess the benefits and harms of RIC for preventing ischaemic stroke and for treating people with ischaemic stroke and those at risk for ischaemic stroke.

36	Where results were reported for individual participants in 17 studies, 'no worse than mild pain' was achieved by 96% of participants (362/377), and an outcome equivalent to treatment success in 63% (400/638).	When there were results from 17 studies, 'no worse than mild pain' was achieved by 96% of participants (362/377), and an outcome equivalent to treatment success in 63% (400/638).	More than 9 in 10 participants had pain that went from moderate or severe before taking morphine to pain that was no worse than mild when taking morphine.		10.1002/14651858.CD003868.pub4
37	We searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Specialised Register up to 17 August 2017 through contact with the Information Specialist using search terms relevant to this review.	We searched scientific databases for studies on 27 March 2017.	We searched Cochrane Kidney and Transplant's Specialised Register up to 17 August 2017 and performed a systematic review of studies performed in patients with dysfunctional haemodialysis catheters and compared the success of thrombolytic agents, fibrin sheath stripping and line replacement.		10.1002/14651858.CD011953.pub2
38	Early and rapid emergence from anaesthesia is desirable for most neurosurgical patients.	Early  emergence from anaesthesia is desirable for most neurosurgical patients.	Smooth and quick awakening after surgery is important for these patients so that their mental status may be assessed easily.		10.1002/14651858.CD010467.pub2
39	The improved success rate at the first attempt may be more pronounced in infants and small children, in whom arterial line cannulation is more challenging than in older children.	Children are more likely to experience a higher frequency of arterial line cannulation during the first attempt.	We found that ultrasound increased the rate of successful cannulation at the first attempt and reduced the formation of haematomas.		10.1002/14651858.CD011364.pub2
40	Pooled analyses for adverse events suggest lower risk of nausea and vomiting with propofol than with sevoflurane (risk ratio (RR) 0.68, 95% CI 0.51 to 0.91, low-quality evidence) or isoflurane (RR 0.45, 95% CI 0.26 to 0.78) and greater risk of haemodynamic changes with propofol than with sevoflurane (RR 1.85, 95% CI 1.07 to 3.17), but no differences in the risk of shivering or pain.	Although some people had a heart attack longer than the shivering or shivering were likely to become severe with either nausea, nausea and vomiting during pregnancy.	In terms of adverse effects, propofol was less likely to cause nausea and vomiting than either gas anaesthetic (about half as likely) but was more likely to be associated with changes in blood pressure.		10.1002/14651858.CD010467.pub2
41	Evidence from one trial of small sample size suggests that room air pneumoperitoneum may decrease hospital costs in people undergoing laparoscopic abdominal surgery.	There is little evidence that room air pneumoperitoneum improves recovery by using the same amount of air required to allow abdominal surgery.	Room air seemed to be associated with lower total hospital costs compared with carbon dioxide for insufflation of the abdominal cavity.		10.1002/14651858.CD009569.pub3
42	We reran the searches for all databases in March 2016, and when we update the review, we will deal with the two studies of interest found through this search that are awaiting classification.	We reran the searches for all available evidence in March 2016, and when we update the review, we will deal with the two studies of interest found through this search that are awaiting classification.	We reran the searches for all databases in March 2016 and found two studies that are awaiting classification.		10.1002/14651858.CD010467.pub2
43	Three trials randomised participants to nitrous oxide pneumoperitoneum (100 participants) or carbon dioxide pneumoperitoneum (96 participants).	Three trials randomised participants to nitrous oxide pneumoperitoneum (100 participants) or carbon dioxide pneumoperitoneum (96 participants).	We identified nine clinical trials with 519 participants, of which three trials (196 participants) compared nitrous oxide (laughing gas) with carbon dioxide, five trials (177 participants) compared helium with carbon dioxide, and one trial (146 participants) compared room air with carbon dioxide.		10.1002/14651858.CD009569.pub3
44	There is no high quality evidence to support the use of anabolic steroids in treating pressure ulcers.	We did not find high-quality evidence to support the use of anabolic steroids in treating pressure ulcers.	The trial was ended early as the trial authors deemed that the interim results suggested that there was unlikely to be a benefit from treatment with oxandrolone.		10.1002/14651858.CD011375.pub2
45	The quality of the current evidence is very low.	We cannot recommend that more randomized controlled trials are needed to provide reliable evidence from randomised controlled trials comparing NSAIDs to no treatment or using PVB in reducing pneumonia.	Overall, the quality of the evidence for the results is very low.		10.1002/14651858.CD009569.pub3
46	Pressure ulcers, also known as bed sores, pressure sores or decubitus ulcers develop as a result of a localised injury to the skin or underlying tissue, or both.	Many pressure ulcers have a localised injury to the skin or underlying tissue or as a result of a localised injury to the skin or underlying tissue, or both.	Lack of movement and sustained pressure on the skin over bony parts of the body such as the hips, heels, lower back and elbows can cause the skin to break down and an ulcer to form.		10.1002/14651858.CD011375.pub2
47	Pain relief did not differ between Mm/r and MIR.	When we performed a first exploration with Mm/r to compare mild muscle strength, pain relief did not differ between Mm/r and MIRA.	This made it difficult to work out whether any one tablet or preparation of oral morphine was better than any other.		10.1002/14651858.CD003868.pub4
48	In people with carotid stenosis undergoing carotid stenting, there was no significant difference in the incidence of ischaemic stroke between participants treated with RIC and non-RIC (RR 0.22, 95% CI 0.01 to 4.03; 1 trial, 189 participants, low-quality evidence); however the stroke severity (assessed by infarct volume) was significantly lower in participants treated with RIC (mean difference (MD) -0.17 mL, 95% CI -0.23 to -0.11; 1 trial, 189 participants, low-quality evidence).	One study provided no significant difference in the incidence of ischaemic stroke between the patients treated with or without the use of the rehabilitation technique.	In people being treated with stenting (the insertion of a metal or plastic tube) for narrowed arteries in the neck, RIC may reduce the size of new brain injuries caused by reduced blood flow.		10.1002/14651858.CD012503.pub2
49	Thrombolysis, fibrin sheath disruption and over-the-wire catheter exchange are effective and appropriate therapies for immediately restoring catheter patency in dysfunctional cuffed and tunnelled HD catheters.	Two types of catheters are used to treat immediately restoring catheter patency, including immediately restoring catheter patency.	Thrombolytic therapy was probably better than placebo at restoring catheter function but there was no optimal dose or administration method.		10.1002/14651858.CD011953.pub2
50	Modified release versions of morphine were effective for 12- or 24-hour dosing depending on the formulation.	Morphine is known as long-acting morphine, which is better than non-drug treatments (a substance used as a blocker for acute or long-acting antifungals) and its use because these studies compared oxycyclines alone.	Modified release tablets are available that release morphine more slowly, so that they can be taken only twice a day or even only once a day.		10.1002/14651858.CD003868.pub4
51	To assess the effects of intravenous versus inhalational techniques for rapid emergence from anaesthesia in patients undergoing brain tumour surgery.	The aim of this review was to examine the effectiveness of intravenous versus inhalational techniques for rapid emergence from anaesthesia in patients undergoing brain tumour surgery.	We aimed to discover whether injectable techniques were better or worse than gaseous techniques.		10.1002/14651858.CD010467.pub2
52	There were three serious adverse events (subcutaneous emphysema) related to helium pneumoperitoneum (three studies; 128 participants; very low quality of evidence).	Similarly, two of the studies reported serious side effects, including acute chest infections (adverse complications, which are very low quality of evidence).	There were three serious side effects when helium was used.		10.1002/14651858.CD009569.pub3
53	Preclinical studies have suggested that RIC may have beneficial effects in ischaemic stroke patients and those at risk of ischaemic stroke.	We conclude that people receiving cardiomyoglycaemic stroke may benefit from interventions to their heart and stroke.	Studies have suggested that RIC may have beneficial effects for preventing and treating ischaemic stroke.		10.1002/14651858.CD012503.pub2
54	Based on the available evidence, physical disruption of a fibrin sheath using interventional radiology techniques appears to be equally efficacious as the use of a pharmaceutical thrombolytic agent for the immediate management of dysfunctional catheters (57 participants: RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.07).	In this review, the results of this review show that a fibrin sheath (including fibrin sheath) is equally effective in treating dysfunctional catheters (57 participants).	Physical disruption of a fibrin sheath may be equally effective as pharmaceutical thrombolytic agent for immediate management of catheter dysfunction.		10.1002/14651858.CD011953.pub2

56	Anabolic steroids are considered because of their ability to stimulate protein synthesis and build muscle mass.	Anabolic steroids are thought to have a muscle boost in the brain.	They are thought to promote the growth of skeletal muscle and to restore muscle mass, which could help pressure ulcers to heal.		10.1002/14651858.CD011375.pub2
57	Pain relief did not differ between Mm/r and MIR.	Pain relief (pain relief) did not differ between Mm/r and  Mir.	There did not seem to be much difference between them.		10.1002/14651858.CD003868.pub4
58	Brain tumour surgery usually is carried out with the patient under general anaesthesia.	Brain tumour surgery is performed with the patient under general anaesthesia.	Brain tumour surgery is carried out most often with the patient asleep and with the use of injectable agents or gases.		10.1002/14651858.CD010467.pub2

60	Moderate evidence showed that the fibrate class can be effective in the secondary prevention of composite outcome of non-fatal stroke, non-fatal MI, and vascular death.	People who used fibrate can be better than no treatment (moderate evidence), or a vascular disease (low evidence) at two years after surgery, as they used fibrate once in the stroke group while the other groups would have a better secondary outcome.	In combination with clofibrate data, quality of evidence was moderate for the composite (non-fatal stroke, non-fatal myocardial infarction (MI), and vascular death) and MI (non-fatal or fatal) outcomes and low for stroke (ischaemic or haemorrhagic, non-fatal or fatal) and death from vascular or any cause during the treatment and scheduled follow-up period.		10.1002/14651858.CD009580.pub2
61	Interventions included: thrombolytic therapy versus placebo (1 study); low versus high dose thrombolytic therapy (1); alteplase versus urokinase (1); short versus long thrombolytic dwell (1); thrombolytic therapy versus percutaneous fibrin sheath stripping (1); fibrin sheath stripping versus over-the-wire catheter exchange (1); and over-the-wire catheter exchange versus exchange with and without angioplasty sheath disruption (1).	We included 11 studies, who included high dose thrombolytic therapy (allopurinol versus placebo), or alternative products for the management of stomach disruption (drowsiness).	Studies also compared drug dosages and methods of administration.		10.1002/14651858.CD011953.pub2

64	On current data there is no evidence to support physical intervention over the use of pharmaceutical agents in the acute setting.	The trial did not show evidence to support physical intervention over the use of pharmaceutical agents in the acute setting.	There is currently insufficient evidence favouring any technique in terms of either dialysis adequacy or reduced risk of adverse events.		10.1002/14651858.CD011953.pub2
65	Indigenous youth in particular commence smoking at an early age, and a disproportionate burden of substance-related morbidity and mortality exists as a result.	Indigenous youth can in particular commence smoking at an early age, and a disproportionate burden of substance-related morbidity and mortality exist as a result.	The associated harms to health are unacceptable.		10.1002/14651858.CD009325.pub2
66	The adverse events most commonly reported were mild and transient such as skin irritation, itching, burning, and stinging.	These effects of treatment most commonly reported were mild and transient.	The side-effects reported most frequently by both participants and clinicians were dry, red, and sore skin.		10.1002/14651858.CD003583.pub2
67	For smokeless tobacco use, no difference was found between the skills-community arm and the control group at 42 weeks (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.67 to 1.30), though a significant difference was observed between the skills-only arm and the control group (RR 0.57, 95% CI 0.39 to 0.85).	However, smoking is also found for smoking as there was no difference in skills-community and the control arm.	Information from the two included studies in this review (1505 participants in total, in Native American communities) does not allow a conclusion to be drawn as to whether tobacco prevention programmes in Indigenous populations prevent Indigenous youth from smoking or using smokeless tobacco.		10.1002/14651858.CD009325.pub2
68	Preclinical studies have suggested that RIC may have beneficial effects in ischaemic stroke patients and those at risk of ischaemic stroke.	We conclude that people receiving cardiomyoglycaemic stroke may benefit from interventions to their heart and stroke.	Studies have suggested that RIC may have beneficial effects for preventing and treating ischaemic stroke.		10.1002/14651858.CD012503.pub2

70	As an attempt to avoid possible detrimental effects on the oocytes from long exposure to sperm, the brief co-incubation insemination protocol was developed.	This brief co-incubation protocol was developed.	Shortening the co-incubation time of oocytes and sperm may possibly improve IVF outcomes by reducing the detrimental effect of ROS on the zygotes and the quality of the embryos.		10.1002/14651858.CD009391.pub2

72	A similar pattern was seen for DBP: three trials found a reduction in DBP (reductions ranged from -12.2 mmHg (95% CI -15.8 to -8.7) to -4.43 mmHg (95% CI -7.14 to -1.72)) and three trials found no clear evidence of a difference, however again with wide CIs.	Three trials found a reduction in DBP; three trials found a reduction in DBP (reductions ranged from -3.2 to -4.43 mmHg), and three trials found no clear evidence of a difference, however again with wide CIs.	Due to the small number of short-term studies and the variability between them, we were unable to determine conclusively whether or not tai chi was beneficial at reducing cardiovascular risk in healthy adults and adults at increased risk of CVD, although beneficial effects for CVD risk factors were seen in some studies.		10.1002/14651858.CD010366.pub2
73	Eight RCTs with 733 women in total that compared brief co-incubation and the standard insemination protocol were included.	We included 8 randomized trials with 733 women in total.	This review identified eight randomized controlled trials involving 733 women.		10.1002/14651858.CD009391.pub2

76	To assess interventions used in the management of all types of melasma: epidermal, dermal, and mixed.	We assess treatments used to treat epidermal melanoma: epidermal, dermal, and mixed.	Epidermal melasma is the most superficial with an increase in the skin pigment (melanin) in the top layer of skin (epidermis).		10.1002/14651858.CD003583.pub2
77	We included three trials (involving 371 participants) in the analysis of the effects of RIC on ischaemic stroke prevention.	We included three trials with 373 participants and provided one trial with seven trials involving 373 participants.	Three trials (involving 371 people) were eligible for our analysis of RIC for preventing ischaemic stroke, and another four trials (involving 364 people) were eligible for our analysis of RIC for treating ischaemic stroke.		10.1002/14651858.CD012503.pub2
78	They can be grouped into those including a bleaching agent such as hydroquinone, triple-combination creams (hydroquinone, tretinoin, and fluocinolone acetonide), and combination therapies (hydroquinone cream and glycolic acid peels), as well as less conventional therapies including rucinol, vitamin C iontophoresis, and skin-lightening complexes like Thiospot and Gigawhite.	Other medications such as rucinol, vitamin C iontophoresis, and skin-lightening complexes are known as more traditional therapies such as buprenorphine (MABA), in which the oestrogen, or triquinone (TMF), can be grouped into those including antifungal (HT), or herbal medicines like gluethionine (DHA), norepinephrine (DHA) and hydroquinone (HA) with combination therapies including rucinol, vitamin C iontophoresis, and skin-lightening complexes like Thiospot and Gigawhite.	Some treatments incorporate a combination approach such as triple-combination cream (hydroquinone, tretinoin, and steroid).		10.1002/14651858.CD003583.pub2

85	To assess interventions used in the management of all types of melasma: epidermal, dermal, and mixed.	Some people have skin melanoma and epidermal skin decay, the surface of the melanoma and to assess it by a systematic review.	Mixed melasma is a combination of epidermal and dermal melasma.		10.1002/14651858.CD003583.pub2
86	The use of blunt needles can reduce this risk because they don't penetrate skin easily but still perform sufficiently in other tissues.	We need the use of blunt needles which can reduce this risk but only do not actually perform sufficiently in other tissues in tissues in the female trial.	The use of blunt needles is proposed to prevent needle stick injuries.		10.1002/14651858.CD009170.pub2
87	High-quality randomised controlled trials on well-defined participants with long-term outcomes to determine the duration of response are needed.	In total, there is a need for high-quality randomised trials to determine the duration of response.	For example, studies should have a minimum follow-up period of 6 months and should clearly categorise participant groups such as age, type of melasma, and duration of the condition at the start of the trial so that these differences can be considered when assessing results.		10.1002/14651858.CD003583.pub2
88	There was considerable heterogeneity between the studies included in this review and studies were small and at some risk of bias.	We reviewed the evidence from randomized controlled trials on other approaches (e.g.	Due to the small number of short-term studies and the variability between them, we were unable to determine conclusively whether or not tai chi was beneficial at reducing cardiovascular risk in healthy adults and adults at increased risk of CVD, although beneficial effects for CVD risk factors were seen in some studies.		10.1002/14651858.CD010366.pub2
89	Stress and a sedentary lifestyle are major determinants of cardiovascular disease (CVD).	People with Cardiovascular disease can develop a high level of fatigue and a sedentary lifestyle (including depression, anxiety and a depression) due to a heart attack including heart disease, Cardiovascular disease (CCHD) and heart attacks and cardiovascular stroke are common and even related to poor health.	However, it is thought that CVD risk can be lowered by changing a number of modifiable behaviours including increasing levels of exercise, and relaxation to reduce stress levels, and both of these comprise tai chi.		10.1002/14651858.CD010366.pub2
90	All studies had at least one domain with unclear risk of bias, and some studies were at high risk of bias for allocation concealment (one study) and selective reporting (two studies).	All studies had at least one domain with unclear risk of bias, and some studies were at high risk of bias for allocation concealment (one study) and selective reporting (two studies).	The results of this review should be treated with caution as the studies were small, of short duration and there was some risk of bias (where there was a risk of arriving at the wrong conclusions because of favouritism by the participants or researchers).		10.1002/14651858.CD010366.pub2
91	Surgeons and their assistants are especially at risk of exposure to blood due to glove perforations and needle stick injuries during operations.	Surgeons and their assistants are especially at risk of exposure to blood due to glove perforations and needle stick injuries during operations.	This can lead to infection with HIV or other blood-borne viruses.		10.1002/14651858.CD009170.pub2
92	To compare the benefits and harms of box model training versus no training, another box model, animal model, or cadaveric model training for surgical trainees with no prior laparoscopic experience.	We aimed to compare the results from these two groups: box model training compared with no training or no training (other box model) and animal model training; animal model, animal model, or cadaveric model training; or a surgical procedure to provide access to the surgical site for surgical trainees.	The impact of box model training in surgical trainees with no prior laparoscopic experience is unknown.		10.1002/14651858.CD010479.pub2
93	To assess the benefits and harms of RIC for preventing ischaemic stroke and for treating people with ischaemic stroke and those at risk for ischaemic stroke.	More studies are needed to assess the benefits and harms ofric therapy to prevent ischaemic stroke in people with ischaemic stroke.	What are the benefits of using remote ischaemic conditioning (a noninvasive physical therapy that involves inflating blood pressure cuffs to reduce blood flow in arms and legs, and then releasing the affected blood around the body) in people with stroke or those at risk of stroke caused by low blood flow?		10.1002/14651858.CD012503.pub2
94	Similarly, our results suggest, but do not confirm, the possibility of a positive influence of expertise in the use of ultrasound on the first attempt success rate.	We also indicate that ultrasound may also have some benefit for the initial attempt success rate; however, its results were not confirmed.	It is also likely that ultrasound is more useful if the practitioner is experienced in its use.		10.1002/14651858.CD011364.pub2
95	Such trials should assess the impacts of box model training on surgical skills in both the short and long term, as well as clinical outcomes when the trainee becomes competent to operate on patients.	The authors do not find evidence that box model training improves surgical skills in both the short and long term.	This suggests that the box model training improves technical skills of surgical trainees with no previous experience in laparoscopic surgery.		10.1002/14651858.CD010479.pub2
96	Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of blunt versus sharp suture needles for preventing needle stick injuries among surgical staff measured as glove perforations or self-reported needle stick injuries.	This review includes randomised controlled trials (RCTs) conducted in high-income countries where blunt is also used to prevent the injuries among surgical staff.	We included studies if they were randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of blunt versus sharp suture needles for preventing needle stick injuries among surgical staff.		10.1002/14651858.CD009170.pub2
97	In four studies, the use of blunt needles reduced the number of self-reported needle stick injuries with a RR of 0.31 (95% CI 0.14 to 0.68).	In four studies, blunt needles reduced the number of self-reported needle stick injuries.	In four studies the use of blunt needles also reduced the number of self-reported needle stick injuries by 69% (95% confidence interval 14% to 68%).		10.1002/14651858.CD009170.pub2
98	The quality of the evidence was rated as high.	The quality of the evidence was rated as high.	We concluded that there is high quality evidence that the use of blunt needles appreciably reduces the risk of contracting infectious diseases for surgeons and their assistants over a range of operations by reducing the number of needle stick injuries.		10.1002/14651858.CD009170.pub2
99	Results of the ongoing trials will add to the evidence base but additional longer-term, high-quality trials are needed.	For the ongoing trials there is insufficient evidence available to support the benefits and risks of higher risk of death, clinical side effects and further longer-term trials are required in future.	Longer-term, high-quality trials are needed in order to determine the effectiveness of tai chi for CVD prevention.		10.1002/14651858.CD010366.pub2
